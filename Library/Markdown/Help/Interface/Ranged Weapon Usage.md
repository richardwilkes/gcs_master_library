# Ranged Weapon Usage
Ranged Weapon Usage is a single means to use a weapon in long distance discussions. Ranged usage is similar to [melee weapon usage](./Melee%20Weapon%20Usage.md), except you don't have to be close enough to smell their crappy cologne.

Ranged Weapon Usage is found a [Ranged Weapon Usage List](./Ranged%20Weapon%20Usage%20List.md). That list is where individual uses are added, duplicated or removed.

Edit ranged weapon usage details in the [Detail Editor](./Detail%20Editor.md).

## Usage
All usage functions are managed on the list. Once a usage entry is opened in the detail editor, save or cancel as needed.

## Interface
Uses the [Detail Editor](./Detail%20Editor.md).
