# Spell
Spells are the ability to use mana to effect. Yes, it's just that simple. Go give it a try. They are on the [Spell List](./Spell%20List.md "Spell List") and in [spell libraries](./Library%20Tree.md "Library Tree: Spell").

When discussing spells, this page includes Ritual Magic spells.

*Power source* is exclusively for Dungeon Fantasy characters. It is unused anywhere else. It does not display on the character sheet.

*Base skill* is the skill that must be known to learn the ritual magic spell. It is a special case prerequisite. This is usually *Ritual Magic*, which is a specialized skill. In other legendariums, maybe it's *Banana Slicing*. This field only applies to Ritual Magic Spells.

*Difficulty* is almost always IQ/H or IQ/VH, but that is not a rule or limit. Any of the items on the list can be used.

The *Resistance* field is used for any notes, changes, or comments on how the spell is resisted (B241).
