# Ranged Weapon Usage List
The Ranged Weapon Usage List is a collection of ways to use a range weapon to inflict damage from a distance, such as throwing, shooting, or mail delivery. This list is available for all [equipment](./Equipment.md), but only applies to range weapons. A toaster, for example, could be used as a range weapon, but flying toast has limited potential for injury.

See [Ranged Weapon Usage](./Ranged%20Weapon%20Usage.md) for details on configuring an individual entry.

## Usage
*For common list functionality, see [List](./List.md).* **Read that first.**

Operations specific to Ranged Weapon Usage lists are detailed here.
