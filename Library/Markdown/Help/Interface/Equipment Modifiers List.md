# Equipment Modifier List
Equipment Modifier Lists are storage for [Equipment Modifier](./Equipment%20Modifier.md "Equipment Modifier"). They are found in [Equipment Modifier Library](./Library%20Tree.md "Library Tree: Equipment Modifier") and [Equipment](./Equipment.md "Equipment") detail editor.

These modifiers are a drag and drop way to make equipment lighter, heavier, cheaper, better, a different color, gift wrapped, or just about any other change you might need. Give it a try!
