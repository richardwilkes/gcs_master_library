# Trait
Traits are advantages, disadvantages and quirks. All of these are found on the [Trait List](./Trait%20List.md) of a [Character Sheet](./Character%20Sheet.md), or in a [Trait Library](./Library%20Tree.md).

## Usage
Traits use the [Detail Editor](./Detail%20Editor.md).

## Fields
- **Name** : Hoc est nomen meum.
- **[Notes](./Notes.md)** : for notes
- **[VTT Notes](./VTT%20Notes.md)** : for vtt notes
- **[User Description](./User%20Description.md)** : for user description
- **[Tags](./Tags.md)** : for shopping lists ... not really ... for meta-data tags
- **Self-Control Roll** : See B121
- **CR Adjustment** : See Self-Control Roll
- **Container Type** : various effects
- **Ancestry** : effects random field values
- **Template Choices** : See [Character Template](./Character%20Template.md)
- **[Page Reference](./Page%20Reference.md)** : a bookmark

Control Roll does not affect calculations, but it does display under the trait on the trait list.

The Container Type can impact how character points are distributed. *Group* means it's just a trait container for holding stuff. Like your lunch. *Meta-Trait* containers allow all the container traits to stay together, as listed (B262). Buying off just one is probably not allowed. Making it a *Race* container, causes the Points field to count the contents of the container against the Race value and activates the Ancestry field. *Alternative Abilities* tends toward being a Supers thing (B61 + Supers). An *Attribute* container puts the contents towards the Attribute value.
