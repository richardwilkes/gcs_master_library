# Mods
Collectively, substitutions and modifications are referred to as mods in this documentation. It's four letters rather than 31. Like i18n. Typing for lazy people.

Substitutions are used in [templates](./Character%20Template.md "Character Template") in the form *@something@*, such as a skill specialization. Modifications are the optional parts of a trait, skill or spell. Limitations and expansions are common among traits. When a template is applied, all the pop-ups asking about this and that, are the substitutions and modifications being resolved.
