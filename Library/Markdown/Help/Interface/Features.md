# Features
Features are modifiers for attributes, DR, level, cost, and more. Features are in the Features block which is found on the detail editor for several elements.

## Usage
### Add
The plus icon ( ![](./img/plus.png "Add") ) adds a rule to the bottom of the list. Stay calm. Order doesn't matter, so it's Ok.

### Delete
Each rule has a trash can ( ![](./img/trash.png "Delete") ) next to it, to delete that rule.

### Modify
Each feature is like building a sentence. Like in *\<insert_native_language_here>* class, had you ever attended. Just set the little field things. The option tree is large and complex, mostly depending on the dropdown values for branching.

## Interface
### Tools
- **Add ( ![](./img/plus.png "Add") )** : adds a feature
- **Delete ( ![](./img/trash.png "Delete") )** : deletes a line
