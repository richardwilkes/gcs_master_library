# Trait List
The Trait List is the compilation of advantages, disadvantages and quirks, collectively referred to as [Traits](./Trait.md "Trait"). It is found on the [Character Sheet](./Character%20Sheet.md "Character Sheet") under *"Trait"*. Who didn't see that coming?

## Usage
*For common list functionality, see [List](./List.md "List").* **Read that first.**

Operations specific to Trait Lists are detailed here.

### Modify
To add Natural Attacks:
- **Item -> Add Natural Attacks**
- **\<context_menu> -> Add Natural Attacks**

To Toggle State:
- **Edit -> Toggle State**
- **\<context_menu> -> Toggle State**

Natural attacks are added as bite, kick, and punch.

**Fancy Tip:** Add natural attacks to the race templates, and turn off adding natural attacks by default in General Settings.

## Columns
Most of the list headers are values defined by GURPS.

- **Trait** : the name column
- **Pts** : points assigned used by the trait
- **[Page Reference](./Page%20Reference.md "Page Reference") ( ![](./img/flag.png "Reference") )** : fancy bookmark links
