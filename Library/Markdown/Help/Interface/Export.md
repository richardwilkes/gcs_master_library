# Export
Export a [Character Sheet](./Character%20Sheet.md "Character Sheet") to another format. Export options are PDF, image formats, and several Virtual Table Top formats.

**File -> Export To... -> \<type>**

The image files are exported at the print resolution defined by [General Settings](./General%20Settings.md "General Settings") *Image Export Resolution*.

**Fancy Tip:** Print the character sheet really small, including the portrait, roll it into a 25mm tube, and there you have it, a table top miniature.
