# Tags
The Tags field is used for meta-data. Tags can be a weapon class, car brand, cold symptoms, version numbers, magic college, parts of the food pyramid, or color, to name a few. Multiple tags are comma separated. Any printed character can be a tag, except a comma. New tags appear on the tag filter dropdown on opening the list file.

Tags are available as [feature](./Features.md "Features") filters.

Tag case sensitivity and duplication are a little complicated.

**Example:**\
Skill 1 Tag: *"One, one, one"\
Skill 2 Tag: *"ONE"*

- Both appear exactly like that in their skill tag fields
- Three tags appear in the dropdown filter: *ONE*, *One* and *one*
- Feature filters will match *One*, *ONE*, *oNE* and *one* to both skills
