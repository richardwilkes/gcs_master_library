# Technique
Techniques are individual feats perfected from a [Skill](./Skill.md "Skill") (B229-233). Any given aspect of a skill is potentially a technique. You can cook? Great! But can you do it upside down? Now you can. And you can add it the "Complete waste of Character Points" [container](./Container.md "Container"). Don't worry, there are plenty of useful techniques available (B229).

Techniques are found on a [Skill List](./Skill%20List.md "Skill List") and in a [Skill Library](./Library%20Tree.md "Library Tree:Skill").

## Usage
From a Usage viewpoint, Techniques and Skills are almost the exact same. Techniques use the [Detail Editor](./Detail%20Editor.md "Detail Editor").

## Fields
Techniques have a number of fields in common with Skills.

- **Name** : "That \<insert_name> technique is \<insert_level>."
- **[Notes](./Notes.md "Notes")** : this again
- **[VTT Notes](./VTT%20Notes.md "VTT Notes")** : that again
- **[Tags](./Tags.md "Tags")** : the other thing again
- **Defaults To** :
  - **Type** : a skill, attribute or other
  - **Name** : skill name
  - **Specialization** : skill specialization, if any
  - **Modifer** : change from skill level, plus or minus
- **Cannot exceed ...** : The technique as a level limit
  - **... by more than** : limit
- **Difficulty** : difficulty level only
- **Points** : A character point reflection of dedication
- **[Page Reference](./Page%20Reference.md "Page Reference")** : bookmarks in spaaaaace

The Default is required. It is most likely a skill, but that is not a rule. It is also most likely a negative modifier. That is also not a rule.

Techniques tend to be limited to the default's skill level or some level below.

*Difficulty* only uses the level, base attribute is set by the default skill.

### Blocks
Techniques uses the same blocks as Skills.

- **[Prerequisites](./Prerequisites.md "Prerequisites")** : get those before this (B169)
- **[Defaults](./Defaults.md "Defaults")** : skill level starting point
- **[Features](./Features.md "Features")** : modifications to an ability
- **[Melee Weapon Usage](./Melee%20Weapon%20Usage.md "Melee Weapon Usage")** : melee use(s) obtained
- **[Range Weapon Usage](./Range%20Weapon%20Usage.md "Range Weapon Usage")** : range use(s) obtained
- **[Study](./Study.md "Study")** : how it was learned

A technique is far more likely to provide a weapon use than a skill.
