# Technique
Techniques are individual feats perfected from a [Skill](./Skill.md) (B229-233). Any given aspect of a skill is potentially a technique. You can cook? Great! But can you do it upside down? Now you can. And you can add it the "Complete waste of Character Points" [container](./Container.md). Don't worry, there are plenty of useful techniques available (B229).

Techniques are found on a [Skill List](./Skill%20List.md) and in a [Skill Library](./Library%20Tree.md).

## Usage
From a Usage viewpoint, Techniques and Skills are almost the exact same. Techniques use the [Detail Editor](./Detail%20Editor.md).

## Fields
Techniques have a number of fields in common with Skills.

- **Name** : "That \<insert_name> technique is \<insert_level>."
- **[Notes](./Notes.md)** : this again
- **[VTT Notes](./VTT%20Notes.md)** : that again
- **[Tags](./Tags.md)** : the other thing again
- **Defaults To** :
  - **Type** : a skill, attribute or other
  - **Name** : skill name
  - **Specialization** : skill specialization, if any
  - **Modifier** : change from skill level, plus or minus
- **Cannot exceed ...** : The technique as a level limit
  - **... by more than** : limit
- **Difficulty** : difficulty level only
- **Points** : A character point reflection of dedication
- **[Page Reference](./Page%20Reference.md)** : bookmarks in spaaaaace

The Default is required. It is most likely a skill, but that is not a rule. It is also most likely a negative modifier. That is also not a rule.

Techniques tend to be limited to the default's skill level or some level below.

*Difficulty* only uses the level, base attribute is set by the default skill.

### Blocks
Techniques uses the same blocks as Skills.

- **[Prerequisites](./Prerequisites.md)** : get those before this (B169)
- **[Defaults](./Defaults.md)** : skill level starting point
- **[Features](./Features.md)** : modifications to an ability
- **[Melee Weapon Usage](./Melee%20Weapon%20Usage.md)** : melee use(s) obtained
- **[Ranged Weapon Usage](./Ranged%20Weapon%20Usage.md)** : ranged use(s) obtained
- **[Study](./Study.md)** : how it was learned

A technique is far more likely to provide a weapon use than a skill.
