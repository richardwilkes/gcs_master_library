# Note
A Note is an entry on a [Note List](./Note.md "Note"). Note lists are found in [Note Libraries](./Library%20Tree.md "Library Tree: Note"), [Character Sheets](./Character%20Sheet.md "Character Sheet"), and [Character Templates](./Character%20Template.md "Character Template"). These entries are for writing character or game related information. They appear, as formatted, at the bottom of the character sheet.

Notes can be dragged and dropped between all Note Lists.

## Usage
From the note list, a note opens in the [Detail Editor](./Detail%20Editor.md "Detail Editor").

See the ***[Markdown Guide](../Markdown%20Guide.md "Markdown Guide")*** for details on the syntax.

There is no hard limit to size. But, it's probably a really bad idea to post War And Peace in a note.
