# Melee Weapon Usage
Melee Weapon Usage is a single means by which a melee weapon is used to inflict damage. Damage done is modified by the available fields below. Non-Melee uses could be added, like using it as a pen, but the purpose of these entries is to track damage types (e.g.: thrust, swing). Besides, are you really just *"signing an autograph"* on your opponent's chest?

Melee Weapon Usage is found on equipment [Melee Weapon Usage List](./Melee%20Weapon%20Usage%20List.md). That list is were individual uses are added, duplicated or removed.

Melee Weapon Usage opens in the [Detail Editor](./Detail%20Editor.md).

## Usage
All usage functions are managed on the list. Once opened in the detail editor, save or cancel as needed.

## Interface
Uses the detail editor.

### Blocks
- [Defaults](./Defaults.md)

A weapon must have at least one default or it will never have a Skill Level score and therefore be unusable. The most common defaults are either an attribute or a skill specific to the equipment (e.g.: whip uses whip skill).
