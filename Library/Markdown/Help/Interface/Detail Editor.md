# Detail Editor
The Detail Editor has the same interface for all the details it edits. The fields change based on what is being edited.

The editor tab displays the type and where the element is from. When something in the editor is changed, an asterisk is set in the tab. Changes always need to be saved or canceled. Close the panel and it will ask which. Or use the tool bar.

Except Save and Cancel, the usage depends on what is being edited, and not the editor.

## Interface
### Tool Bar
- **View scale** : as a percentage
- **Save ![](./img/check.png "Save")** :  save and close
- **Cancel ![](./img/no.png "Cancel")** : cancel and close
