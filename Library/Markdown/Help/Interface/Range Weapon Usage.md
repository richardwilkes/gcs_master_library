# Range Weapon Usage
Range Weapon Usage is a single means to use a weapon in long distance discussions. Range usage is similar to [melee weapon usage](./Melee%20Weapon%20Usage.md "Melee Weapon Usage"), except you don't have to be close enough to smell their crappy cologne.

Range Weapon Usage is found a [Range Weapon Usage List](./Range%20Weapon%20Usage%20List.md "Range Weapon Usage List"). That list is where individual uses are added, duplicated or removed.

Edit range weapon usage details in the [Detail Editor](./Detail%20Editor.md "Detail Editor").

## Usage
All usage functions are managed on the list. Once a usage entry is opened in the detail editor, save or cancel as needed.

## Interface
Uses the [Detail Editor](./Detail%20Editor.md "Detail Editor").

### Blocks
