# Skill List
The Skill list is on the [Character Sheet](./Character%20Sheet.md "Character Sheet"). It is also the goal to all this. A list of all the game related [skills](./Skill.md "Skill"). A character can have all the attributes, traits and body types they want, but if they can't actually do anything, they might as well go into politics.

[Techniques](./Technique.md "Technique") are also on this list, but that's a lot of extra typing to call it the *Skill/Technique List*.

## Usage
*For common list functionality, see [List](./List.md "List").* **Read that first.**

Operations specific to Skill Lists are detailed here.

### Modify
Change *point* amount:
- **Edit -> (Increment|Decrement)**
- **\<context menu> -> (Increment|Decrement)**

Change *skill* level:
- **Edit -> (Increment|Decrement) Skill Level**
- **\<context menu> -> (Increment|Decrement) Skill Level**

Update Defaults:
- **Edit -> Swap Defaults**
- **\<context menu> -> Swap Defaults**

Defaults are complex. If a skill has six possible defaults, how would GCS know which one to pick? By using this function, that's how. This option is only available with GCS thinks there is a better alternative.

## Columns
The list headers are basic GURPS defined values.
- **Skill/Technique** : the name column
- **SL** : skill level
- **RSL** : relative skill level (relative to base attribute)
- **Pts** : points assigned to skill
- **Reference ( ![](./img/flag.png "Reference") )** : link to reference
