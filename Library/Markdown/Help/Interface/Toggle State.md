# Toggle State
Toggle State is menu option available for several elements. When toggled off, the element is disabled, and the [Character Sheet](./Character%20Sheet.md "Character Sheet") is recalculated.

You can probably work out what toggle on does.

**Fancy Tip:** As a reminder, add a trait and set it up for your next available character points. Then when you get the points, just toggle the trait on. Good planning!
