# Settings
This applies to everything in the menu bar *Settings* sub-menu. See *Related* below.

Settings can be exported and imported to sets, which will appear under the settings menu ( ![](./img/bars.png "Menu") ), along with the Import and Export options.

## Settings Location
*YOU* can save *YOUR* files anywhere. It's a free country. However, for GCS to recognize them, the directory path and file extensions are vital. There are two locations that will allow them to auto-populate under menu button.

**\<library>\\<settings.file>**\
**\<library>\\Settings\\<settings.file>**

When using the Settings sub-directory, further sub-directories are possible, to any depth. Though you should stop and ask yourself, "why?", before doing that. Menu list naming is based on the filename, and the setting type is based on the file extension. Duplicate names are shown. Regardless of the directory structure, all settings are displayed in a single menu column, grouped by library name only.

Save custom settings under the user libraries. If they are stored in the Master Library, the next time it is updated, all those saved settings will mysteriously vanish.

## Usage
This reference is for common functions for everything under the menu bar "Settings". See the related parent for specific details.

### Export
Export the settings to a JSON file. The can be shared from there.

### Import
Pretty much the opposite of Export. Open a file and read the settings for use.

BUT ... *if they have been properly saved*, just select the settings name from the menu.
