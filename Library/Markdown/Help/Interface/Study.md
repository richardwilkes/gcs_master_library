# Study
Study is a time tracking list for learning [skills](./Skill.md "Skill"), [spells](./Spell.md "Spell"), and [traits](./Trait.md "Trait") (B292-294). Even advantages are learnable. And while no one would normally go to school to become disadvantaged, no one is stopping you.

The study block is part of the Skill/Spell/Trait [Detail Editor](./Detail%20Editor.md "Detail Editor") panel.

## Usage
### Add
**click the plus button**

### Modify
Edit fields in the Study block.

### Delete
**click the trash button**

This is handy for when you get an *F* for being perpetually late, and bringing beer to class, as a "hangover cure".

## Interface
### Tools
At the top:
- **Add ( ![](./img/plus.png "Add") )** : adds a new row

For each line:
- **Delete ( ![](./img/trash.png "Delete") )** : delete one row

## Fields
There is a summary display at the top, which also appears in the Skill/Spell/Trait list.

Each line has mysterious, unnamed fields:
- **Type** : how the training took place
- **Hours** : how much time
- **\<line_summary>** : based on the type and hours, the effective hours are calculated and added to the summary
- **Note** : for report cards, doctor's notes, or a date you actually showed up for class
