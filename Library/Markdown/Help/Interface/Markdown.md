# Markdown
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a markup language. It is lightweight for simple formatting and fast rendering, as opposed to XML or HTML. The basis for GCS markdown is [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), with some modification to suit. We'll call it *Richmark*, within the scope of this sentence.

Markdown support has existed since GCS 5.5.0. It's available in Note entries and as separate
 text files that can be placed anywhere in the Library Tree. With the .md extension, it's happily recognized as markdown and gets a nice little icon ( ![]( ./img/lib-markdown.png "Markdown") ).

Markdown files open in the markdown editor. This editor has it's own displayed base [font](./Font.md "Fonts").

See the [Markdown Guide](../Markdown%20Guide.md "Markdown Guide") for syntax details.

## Usage
### Create
**File -> New Markdown File**

Creates a new document, in memory only. It must be saved to create the file.

### Modify
**<double_click_library_file>**

For files, it opens in the markdown editor.

### Save
With the file active:
**File -> Save**

Can be saved anywhere, but different markdown editors might not like the syntax modifications. Saving the file in the Library Tree allows GCS file management.

### Delete
**<context_menu> -> Delete**

## Interface
### Tool bar
- **View Scale** : as a percentage
- **Edit Mode ( ![]( ./img/pen.png "Edit Mode") )** : toggle edit mode
