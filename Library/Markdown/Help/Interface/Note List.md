# Note List
A Note, as opposed to the [notes field](./Notes.md "Notes"), is a block containing zero or more note entries. Note entries are stored in Note Libraries, character sheets, and templates. They can be dragged and dropped all around. Like Note carpet bombing. When a template is applied, all note entries are transferred to the character sheet.

By default, Note blocks appear at the bottom of character sheets and templates.

Note entries use the [Detail Editor](./Detail%20Editor.md "Detail Editor").

See [Library Tree](./Library%20Tree.md "Library Tree") for library management details.

## Usage
Management is from an active Note Library or either note block. Note entries can be a [container](./Container.md "Container").

### New
- **Item -> New Note**
- **\<context_menu> -> New Note**

Adds a note and opens the Detail Editor.

### Add
Note elements can be duplicated from other Note storage with drag and drop.

### Sort
Click the header to get a lexicographic sort. Click it again to get a reverse sort.

### Modify
Select entry:
- **Edit -> Open Detail Editor**
- **\<context_menu> -> Open Detail Editor**
- **double click item**

Drag and drop to reorder the entries.

### Duplicate
- **Edit -> Duplicate**
- **\<context_menu> -> Duplicate**

### Delete
- **Edit -> Delete**
- **\<context_menu> -> Delete**

## Interface
### Menu Bar
- **View Scale** : as a percentage
- **Expand/Collapse ( ![](./img/tree.png "Expand/Collapse") )**: all at once
- **Fit Width ( ![](./img/dblarrow.png "Fit Width") )**: fit column widths

These are library lists only.

### Context Menu
A Note Library, character and template note blocks all have the same context menu and menu options.

As noted above:
- **New Note** : adds a note at current level
- **New Note Container** : yes, it can use [containers](./Container.md "Container")
- **Open Detail Editor** : Open to edit
- **Duplicate** : Copy in place.
- **Delete** : poof. it's gone.
- **Convert to Container** : poof. it's magic.

## Fields
- **Note** : the entire contents of the note
- **[Page Reference](./Page%20Reference.md "Page Reference") ( ![]( ./img/flag.png "Page Reference") )** : PDF links to stuff about the note, or any random link you like
