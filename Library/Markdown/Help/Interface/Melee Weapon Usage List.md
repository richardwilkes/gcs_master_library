# Melee Weapon Usage List
The Melee Weapon Usage List is a collection of ways to use an item to inflict damage, such as a swing, stab, or badminton slam. This list is available for all [equipment](./Equipment.md "Equipment") elements, but commonly only applied to equipment that is considered a melee weapon. Although, pillows are the primary armament in a pillow fight.

See [Melee Weapon Usage](./Melee%20Weapon%20Usage.md "Melee Weapon Usage") for details on configuring an individual entry.

## Usage
*For common list functionality, see [List](./List.md "List").* **Read that first.**

Operations specific to Melee Weapon Usage lists are detailed here.

### Add
Melee Weapon Usage is stored only in this list, but line items can be dragged and dropped to other Melee Weapon Usage lists.

### Modify
Items can't be modified from the list. Open them in the detail editor.

## Columns
- **\<usage>** : The usage from the ... usage ... field
- **SL** : Skill level, based on character sheet values, otherwise empty
- **Parry** : bonus to parry
- **Block** : bonus to block
- **Damage** : base damage for weapon, modified by character sheet values
- **Reach** : melee'ing distance
- **ST** : minimum strength to wield

These fields are weapon statistics for GURPS (B268-271). They are calculated by the values of the weapon usage and character sheet. Some are empty  until applied to a character sheet. A *Dagger of Toast Buttering* doesn't have a 30 skill until someone picks it up.
