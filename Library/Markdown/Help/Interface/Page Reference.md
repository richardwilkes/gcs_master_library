# Page Reference
The Page Reference field is for annotations to links of external PDF files. These can be official GURPS documents or just some How To on breeding earth worms. GCS won't judge you.

Page references are used in conjunction with [Page Reference Mappings](./Page%20Reference%20Mappings.md "Page Reference Mappings") and the [External PDF Viewer](./General%20Settings.md "General Settings") setting.

There are default mappings, such as B meaning Basic Set. The defaults are the same as the references used through the GURPS library of books. The defaults can be overridden.

Format:\
**\<name>[:]\<page>**

Reference names are case sensitive.

The colon can be omitted if there are no numbers in the name. Both E2 and E:2 mean map E page 2. E12 means map E page 12, but E1:2 means map E1, page 2.

Comma separate multiple references. This is denoted by a plus sign displayed next to the first reference. Open the first reference by clicking the name. The first or *all* references are opened with the context menu.

**Fancy Tip:** Use lowercase references to avoid name collisions with the defaults.
