# Equipment Modifiers
Equipment Modifiers are alterations to standard hardware. It could be a change in weight, cost, features, or other aspects (e.g.: a +3 Dagger of Bagel Slicing). These modifiers are found in the [Equipment Modifier List](./Equipment%20Modifier%20List.md "Equipment Modifier List") under the [equipment](./Equipment.md "Equipment") detail editor and in an [Equipment Modifier Library](./Library%20Tree.md "Library Tree: Equipment Modifier").

## Usage
Equipment Modifiers use the [Detail Editor](./Detail%20Editor.md "Detail Editor").

The equipment detail editor or equipment modifier library must be active to access menu options for these functions.

## Fields
- **Name** : as displayed on the equipment detail, any ol' name will do
- **Tech Level** : Per B27
- **[Notes](./Notes.md "Notes")**
- **[VTT Notes](./VTT%20Notes.md "VTT Notes")**
- **Enable** : disable to remove bonus'
- **Cost Modifier** : See B345
- **Weight Modifier** : multipliers for weight
- **[Tags](./Tags.md "Tags")**

Weight Modifier is a fairly specific use case. Normally, a different piece of equipment at a different weight is created (e.g.: a steel backpack frame vs an aluminum one) as a different item.
