# Points Record
The Points Record is a list of character point changes. The first record is the starting points from [General Settings](./General%20Settings.md "General Settings:"). Using records is not required. You can just keep changing the first record and no one will know.
 The points sum is used in the [Points](./Character%20Sheet.md "Character Sheet:Points") block.

## Usage
Alter the current record(s) or add a new one.
 It's all done with the tool buttons.

## Interface
### Tool Bar
- **[Save](./Common%20Icon.md "Common Icon:Save") ( ![](./img/check.png "Save") )** : save and close
- **[Cancel](./Common%20Icon.md "Common Icon:Cancel") ( ![](./img/no.png "Cancel") )** : cancel and close
- **[Add](./Common%20Icon.md "Common Icon:Add") ( ![](./img/plus.png "Add") )** : add a record

## Fields
- **When** :
  - The date is a specific format.
  - The value can be changed, but it won't go well unless the format is followed.
- **Points** : signed floating point number
- **Reason** : *"Just because"* is perfectly acceptable.

Yes, decimal numbers are allowed. Why? Because, some traits and skills allow half points. And some mean and vindictive GMs assign them, just so you miss the next level.

If the sign is left out, plus is used.

### Tools
- **Delete ( ![](./img/trash.png "Common icon#Delete") )** : remove a specific record with the  icon next to each record. If all records are deleted, the Point total is 0.
