# Skill
Skills are the characters ability to do something. These are usually game related, as *'blowing bubbles with my nose'* might be a waste of character points. Skills are found on the [skill list](./Skill%20List.md "Skill List"), along with [Techniques](./Technique.md "Technique").

There is a Skill Library that can be added to the [Library Tree](./Library%20Tree.md "Library Tree").

## Usage
Skills use the [Detail Editor](./Detail%20Editor.md "Detail Editor"). Don't forget to save your work!

Difficulty is a combination of a controlling attribute and a difficulty level. The attribute can be anything listed, but usually one of the base attributes. See B168 for details. The *10* is there in case the skill is based on number 10, which is just after 9 and prior to 11. This is a free GCS exclusive. W is for Wildcard skills (B175).
