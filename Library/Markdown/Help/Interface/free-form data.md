# Free-Form Data
Free-form data is a field that accepts (almost) any UTF-8 characters. [Klingon](http://klingon.wiki/En/Unicode), for example.

Some fields accept a hard return, some do not. To find out which, click on the field and press Enter. Results should be immediate.

Most of the [Character Sheet](./Character%20Sheet.md "Character Sheet") *Identity* and *Description* blocks are free-form, which don't allow hard return.

Tab is not allowed. Even if you can manage to insert one, it just gets seen as an unrecognized character. I suppose if you put four next to each other, you'll get four little red boxes indenting your text. Congratulations. Although, that is more or less what the space character is for.
