# User Description
A handy place to put a note. It can even hold a description of the user.  It doesn't do anything or filter anywhere. The contents also don't show up on the [Character Sheet](./Character%20Sheet.md "Character Sheet").

This field is [free-form](./Free-Form%20Data.md "Free-Form Data") and accepts hard returns.
