| skill_level(name, specialization, relative) | Looks for a skill with `name` and `specialization` and returns its level or 0 if it can't be found. If `relative` is true, the relative level is returned instead. **Not available prior to v5.4.**                                                                                                             |
| sqrt(number)                                | Returns the positive square root of `number`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ssrt(length, units, flag)                   | Returns a value from the Size and Speed/Range Table on [B550](B550). `length` should be a number. `units` should be one of `in`, `ft`, `yd`, `mi`, `cm`, `km`, or `m`. `flag` should be true to have it return the size modifier or false to return the speed/range modifier. **Not available prior to v4.32.** |
| ssrt_to_yards(size_modifier)                | Returns the number of yards for the given `size_modifier` from the Size and Speed/Range Table on [B550](B550). **Not available prior to v4.32.**                                                                                                                                                                |
| subtract_dice(dice_spec1, dice_spec2)       | Subtracts the first dice specification from the second and returns a string suitable for passing to the `roll(dice_spec)` function. `subtract_dice(3d+1, 2d+2)` would return `1d-1`. **Not available prior to v5.19.**                                                                                          |
| trait_level(name)                           | Looks for a trait with the `name` and returns its level or -1 if it can't be found. **Not available prior to v5.**                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| weapon_damage(description, usage)           | Looks for an equipped weapon with the specified description and usage and returns its resolved damage string, or an empty string if it cannot be found. **Not available prior to v5.19.**                                                                                                                       |
