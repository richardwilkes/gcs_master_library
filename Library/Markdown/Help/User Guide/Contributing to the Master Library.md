The **[Master Library](./library%20explorer)** is the built-in collection that comes with GCS. It includes hundreds of official traits, skills, spells, and equipment taken from GURPS books and other supplements.

Most of the content was entered by **GCS users** and shared back with the community. By contributing, you help expand the library so everyone can spend less time typing and more time playing.

If something is missing (or if you notice an error), you have three ways to contribute:
1. **Submit a Pull Request (preferred):**
	- If you’ve fixed or created content, submit it directly so it can be merged into the Master Library via a GitHub Pull Request (instructions below).
2. **Open an Issue with your files:**
	- If you can't make a Pull Request, create a new **Issue** on the [GCS Master Library repository](https://github.com/richardwilkes/gcs_master_library/issues).
	- Attach your modified file(s) and include a clear explanation of what you changed.
	- Maintainers or other contributors may merge it for you.
3. **Request content:**
	- Create a new **Issue** on GitHub and describe what content you’d like to see added (or fixed). Include the source and any relevant pages.
	- Another community member may add it for you (though this isn’t guaranteed).

## Before you contribute

> [!WARNING]
> Be mindful of **[copyright restrictions](https://www.sjgames.com/general/online_policy.html)**. You can include names, point costs, and short notes, but never copy descriptive text, full rules, or passages from books.

1. **Respect copyright.** Only add game-aid information like names, point costs, brief notes, and page references.
2. **Use the standard book abbreviations for [Page References](Page%20References).** If the book isn't listed, ask first so maintainers can update it.
3. **Use [Containers](Containers) if creating [character templates](Character%20templates).** Consistency makes content easier for everyone to use.
4. **Test your content.** Apply it to a blank character sheet first to make sure it works as expected.

## Submitting your contribution
The Master Library is maintained on **GitHub**. Contributions are made by submitting a **Pull Request (PR)**.

> [!TIP]
> If you’re new to GitHub, check out the [GitHub Docs: Contributing to projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

To submit your content:
1. Create a free GitHub account if you don’t already have one.
2. Go to the [GCS Master Library repository](https://github.com/richardwilkes/gcs_master_library).
3. **Fork** the repository to make your own copy under your account.
4. **Clone your fork** to your computer using GitHub Desktop or the command line.
5. In your fork, **create a new branch** for your changes. 
	- Use a clear name to describe your change.
6. Edit or [create custom content](custom%20content) in the library files in your branch.
	- Place your new items in the correct **library**. Libraries are usually organized by the book the data comes from.
	- Follow the existing file structure so content stays organized.
7. **Commit** your changes, then **push** the branch to your fork.
8. On GitHub, open a **Pull Request (PR)** from your branch to the main repository.
	- Clearly describe what you changed (for example, “Added Dwarf template” or “Corrected point cost for Ally advantage”).
9. Tag the **Librarians** (`@Librarian`) in the [GCS Discord](https://discord.gg/MKhuDPPagY) libraries channel so they know your PR is ready for review.

## What happens next
- The project maintainers will review your submission.
- They may request changes for consistency, accuracy, or formatting.
- Once approved, your contribution will be merged into the Master Library and becomes available to all users after they update the Master Library in GCS.
