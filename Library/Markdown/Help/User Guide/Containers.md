Containers are one of the most important organizational tools in GCS. They let you group items for clarity, automate totals (like weight or points), and power advanced features in [character templates](Character%20templates).

You can create containers for [Traits](Traits), [Skills](Skills), [Spells](Spells), [Equipment](Equipment), and [Notes](Notes).

Containers let you **group and organize items**. For example:

- Put multiple advantages in an “Ancestry” group.
- Nest a **pouch** inside a **backpack** for equipment.
- Group spells by college or theme.

A container is identified by the **expand/collapse arrow** ![](./images/icons/icn-folderExpand.svg) next to its name. Depending on the type, you may also see extra details, such as **container type** (Traits) or **template choice settings** (Templates).

Containers can also hold other containers, so you can build complex structures when needed.

- Expand or collapse a container with the arrow ![](./images/icons/icn-folderExpand.svg).
- Show or hide **all containers** with the expand/collapse button ![](./images/icons/icn-expand.svg).
- Totals (points, weight, value) include all contents automatically, depending on container type.

## Creating a container

To create a container:

1. On your character sheet, go to **Item > New `[type]` Container**.
   - The available types are **Trait**, **Skill**, **Spell**, **Equipment**, and **Notes**.
2. A new empty container will appear in the appropriate section of your sheet.
3. Edit the container’s fields in the **Detail Editor** (see field tables below).

You can rename, tag, or add notes to containers to keep your sheet organized.

## Moving items in and out of containers

To move something into a container:

1. **Drag and drop** the item within the container.
   - The highlight must appear **indented** to place it inside.
   - If the highlight is flat (not indented), the item will go _below_ the container instead of inside it.
2. To move an item back out, drag it until the highlight is no longer indented.

> [!TIP]  
> For equipment, container contents count toward the **container’s weight and value** totals (for example, a backpack full of gear).

## Ancestry container type

If your group of traits is specific to an ancestry type (like Elf, Dwarf, or Human) you can specify this in the container. The container will include a tag for **Ancestry** on the character sheet.

To select the ancestry:

- For **Container Type**, select **Ancestry** and choose the **Ancestry type**.

This ensures that GCS applies the correct metadata (like random names, height, and weight).

## Template Choices

When creating [Character templates](Character%20templates), (p. B258), containers can also act as **choice groups**. This lets you enforce that a character picks a certain **number of options** or spends a certain **amount of points** from the container’s contents.

You can set the Template Choice type to:

- **Not applicable:** Default. Container just groups items.
- **Points:** Character must select items that total a point value.
- **Count:** Character must select a certain number of items.

The template choices use [Operators](Operators) (`is at least`, `is at most`, `is`) to specify the point and count requirements.

### Example Template Choices

| Statement                                           | Select                 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Advantages**: _X points chosen from among..._     | `Points` `is at most`  |
| **Disadvantages**: _-X points chosen from among..._ | `Points` `is at least` |
| **Skills**: _Select X skills from:_                 | `Count` `is`           |

You can also **nest containers** (for example, one “Pick 1 of 3 Skills” box inside another “Pick 10 Points of Skills” box). GCS handles simple nesting automatically, but very complex setups may be better documented in the template notes. See [Character templates](Character%20templates) for more details on creating templates with advanced containers.

> [!TIP]  
> If you’re not building templates, you can ignore Template Choices. They don’t affect day-to-day use of containers.

For recommendations on how to structure Template Choices effectively, see **Best practices for templates** on [Character templates](Character%20templates).
