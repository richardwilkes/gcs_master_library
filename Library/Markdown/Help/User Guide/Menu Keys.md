Menu keys are **keyboard shortcuts** that let you perform actions in GCS more quickly without navigating menus.

- On **Windows**, shortcuts usually use the **`Ctrl`** key (for example, `Ctrl+S` to save).
- On **Mac**, the same shortcuts typically use the **`Command (⌘)`** key instead (for example, `⌘+S` to save).

GCS comes with several shortcuts pre-set for common actions (like copy, paste, or scaling the sheet). You can **add new shortcuts** or **change existing ones** to match your preferences.

To open the **Menu Keys** settings:

- Go to **Settings > Menu Keys.**

## Managing Settings

You can manage Menu Keys settings the same way as other settings:

- **Reset settings to defaults:** Select **Reset** ![](./images/icons/icn-reset.svg).
- **Import or export settings:** On the **Menu Keys toolbar**, select **Menu** ![](./images/icons/icn-menu.svg), then choose:
  - **Import:** Load saved settings into GCS.
  - **Export:** Save your current settings as a file.

## Changing a shortcut

To change a shortcut:

1. Go to **Settings > Menu Keys**.
2. Select the **shortcut box** next to the action you want to edit.
3. In the pop-up, press the keyboard combination you want to use (for example, `Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`).
4. Select **Set** to save your new shortcut.

You can remove a shortcut by clearing the field or reset it by selecting **Reset** ![](./images/icons/icn-reset.svg).

> [!WARNING]
> Some shortcuts may **conflict with system-level hotkeys** (for example, `Cmd+Space` on macOS opens Spotlight). If a shortcut doesn’t seem to work in GCS, try assigning a different combination that isn’t already reserved by your operating system.

For other settings options, see [General Settings](General%20Settings).
