You can use GCS to track study hours for [Skills](Skills), [Spells](Spells), or [Traits](Traits). This helps you follow the **Improvement Through Study** rules (p. B292).

## Changing total hours needed for study

By default, you need **200 hours of study** for 1 character point.

You can change this in the **Study section** of the Detail Editor to reflect special cases:

- **Standard learning:** The default 200 hours.
- **Talents:** Each Talent level (1-4) reduces the time needed by **10% per level**.
  - Talent 1: 180 hours
  - Talent 2: 160 hours
  - Talent 3: 140 hours
  - Talent 4: 120 hours

> [!TIP]  
> Adjust the **Standard Learning** value in the Study section to account for Talents, Magery, or other special rules. This ensures GCS calculates the correct required hours.

## Adding study entries

To log study time:

1. Open the **Detail Editor** for the skill, spell, or trait.
2. Update the **Standard Learning** value if you need fewer than 200 hours (for example, due to Talents or Magery).
3. In the **Study** section, select **Add** ![](./images/icons/icn-add.svg).
4. Enter the details for the study entry (see below).

Save your changes when you’re done. See **Saving study entries** below.

## Study entries

Each study entry includes the following fields:

| Field             | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Study type**    | How you studied. Choose from the **Study types** table below.                |
| **Hours studied** | Enter the number of hours spent studying.                                    |
| **Hours learned** | Read-only. Shows the calculated total hours learned based on the study type. |
| **Notes**         | (Optional) Add any notes about this study session.                           |

GCS automatically calculates:

- **Effective study hours**, based on the study type (see below).
- **Total accumulated hours** toward your next point.

You can also enter **negative study hours** to track when study time was _converted into character points_. This lets you record that you’ve earned a point while keeping a complete study history instead of deleting your old entries.

**Example:** After reaching 200 hours and gaining 1 character point, add a new study entry with **–200 hours** to reset your progress. Your total hours return to 0, but your log still shows the time you invested.

### Study types

| Study type               | Multiplier | Description                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Self-taught**          | ×0.5       | Every 2 hours count as 1 hour of learning. |
| **On-the-job training**  | ×0.25      | Every 4 hours count as 1 hour of learning. |
| **Professional teacher** | ×1.0       | Counts at full value.                      |
| **Intensive training**   | ×2.0       | Every hour counts as 2 hours of learning.  |

## Deleting study entries

To remove a study entry:

- Select **Delete** ![](./images/icons/icn-delete.svg).

## Gaining a point

When you’ve reached the required hours (normally 200), you must:

1. **Add 1 [character point](Character%20points) to your sheet**. This represents the point earned through study.
2. **Increment the skill, spell, or trait** you were studying once to spend the new point (GCS will subtract from your total unspent points when applying the point).
3. **Delete the completed study entries** to reset your log for future study.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GCS does not automatically award points when you reach the required study hours. You must apply the point to your character points and update the skill, spell, or trait yourself.

## Saving study entries

On the Detail Editor toolbar:

- **Apply changes:** Select **Apply Changes** ![](images/icons/icn-applyChanges.svg) to save.
- **Discard changes:** Select **Discard changes** ![](./images/icons/icn-discardChanges.svg) to exit without saving.
