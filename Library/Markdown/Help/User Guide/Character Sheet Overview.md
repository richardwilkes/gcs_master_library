In GCS, the **character sheet** is where you add your traits, skills, spells, equipment, and other information from the [Library Explorer](Library%20Explorer) when building your GURPS character (p. B10).

See [Create your first character](Create%20your%20first%20character) for a step-by-step guide in building a character without overwhelming you with details.

## Creating a character sheet

- Select **File > New Character Sheet**. You can also press `Ctrl+N` (or `Cmd+N` on macOS) on your keyboard.

A blank character sheet opens with defaults:

- A randomly generated name and description
- All primary attributes set to 10
- A humanoid body type
- 250 unspent character points (your starting points).

You can change these defaults in [Default Settings](Default%20Settings).

## Opening a character sheet

- **From the User Library:** Double-click the sheet in the [Library Explorer](Library%20Explorer).
- **From another location:** Select **File > Open** (`Ctrl+O` / `Cmd+O`), browse to the file, and select **Open**.

## Saving a character sheet

To save your work:

- **Save:** Select **File > Save** (`Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`).
- **Save As:** Select **File > Save As** (`Ctrl+Shift+S` / `Cmd+Shift+S`).

> [!NOTE]
> An asterisk (`*`) on the tab means the sheet has unsaved changes.

## Exporting a character sheet

- Select **File > Export**, then choose a format:
  - **PDF** (printable sheets)
  - **PNG / JPEG / WEBP** (images)
  - **Fantasy Grounds** (VTT integration)
  - **HTML / Text** (simple exports)
  - **Obsidian Markdown** (for Obsidian vaults)

## Printing a character sheet

- Select **File > Print** (`Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`), choose your printer and settings, then select **Print**.

## Character sheet blocks

Your character sheet in GCS is divided into blocks, each focusing on a specific part of your character. These blocks update automatically as you add or change content, so you don’t have to calculate everything by hand.

The table below gives an overview of each block. You can click through to individual pages for a deeper dive into how each one works.

| Block                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Master Library Syncing

GCS tracks whether items on your character sheet match the official **Master Library**. Look for the **Library Source Match** icon ![](images/icons/icn-source.svg) next to items on your sheet.

- **Blank field:** Matches the Master Library.
- **Exclamation mark (`!`):** Different from the Master Library. This happens if you edited the item or if the library was updated (for example, a bug fix).
- **Dash (`-`):** Custom or imported item that isn’t part of the Master Library.

### Syncing items

By default, changes in the Master Library don’t affect your sheet. To update your sheet so it matches the library, you can resync:

- **Sync a single item:** Right-click the item and select **Sync with source**.
- **Sync everything at once:** Select **Sync with all sources** ![](images/icons/icn-syncSources.svg) in the character sheet toolbar.

> [!caution]  
> If you intentionally customized an item (for example, modified a skill or piece of equipment), don’t resync it or it will overwrite your changes.

## Character sheet toolbar

The toolbar above the character sheet gives you quick access to common actions:
