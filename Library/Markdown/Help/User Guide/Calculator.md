The **Calculator** in GCS provides quick tools for resolving common movement and action checks from the rules. These calculators automatically use your character’s **attributes** and **encumbrance** values to display results, saving you from manual table lookups and calculations.

## Opening the calculator

To open the calculator from your [character sheet](Character%20Sheet%20Overview):

- Select **Calculator** ![](./images/icons/icn-calculator.svg) from the **Character Sheet toolbar**.

## Jumping

To calculate your character's jumping distance (p. B352), enter the **running start** and any **penalty for extra effort**. The calculator shows:

- **High Jump** distance (vertical leap).
- **Broad Jump** distance (horizontal leap).

## Throwing

To calculate your character's throwing distance (p. B355), enter the object’s **weight** and any **extra effort penalty**. The calculator shows:

- **Throwing Distance** in yards.
- **Throwing Damage** (based on ST and object weight).

## Hiking

To calculate your character's hiking distance (p. B351), choose the **terrain** and **weather**, and check modifiers that apply:

- **Roads cleared** (depends on weather).
- **Using skis** or **skates**.
- **Successful Hiking roll** (p. B200).
- **Penalty for extra effort**.

The calculator then shows your **daily travel distance** in miles.

> [!TIP]  
> These calculators are **reference tools only**. They do not affect your sheet and are there for quick lookups during play.
