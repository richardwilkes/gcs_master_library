The **Melee Weapon list** and **Ranged Weapon list** on your [character sheet](Character%20Sheet%20Overview) show all of your character’s weapons (p. B268–B276), their usage statistics, and related notes.

These lists include:

- **Natural attacks** (bite, kick, punch).
- **Weapons** from [Equipment](Equipment).
- **Melee and missile spells** from [Spells](Spells).

Weapons are added through the **Equipment list**. An item with a **Melee** or **Ranged Weapon Usage** automatically appears in the appropriate weapon list. To change or delete a weapon, edit or remove the item from the **Equipment list**.

> [!NOTE]
> Normally, only **carried** _and_ **equipped** weapons appear here. If you enable **Show all weapons** in [Sheet Settings](Sheet%20Settings), GCS will also display weapons from items that are _not_ carried or equipped. These are clearly marked as `(not carried)` or `(not equipped)`, as appropriate.

### Master Library

GCS includes hundreds of official weapons in the **Master Library**. See [Library Explorer](Library%20Explorer) for more details.

You can also create your own custom weapons.

## Adding weapons

Weapons are not created directly in the Melee or Ranged Weapon lists. Instead:

- Add a weapon the same way you add [Equipment](Equipment) or [Spells](Spells).
- If the item has **Melee Weapon Usage** or **Ranged Weapon Usage** fields filled out in the Detail Editor, it automatically appears in the appropriate weapon list.

Some weapons can have **multiple usages**. For example, a spear may have a **thrust impaling** attack and a **swing cutting** attack, which appear as separate rows.

To add natural attacks (bite, kick, and punch):

- Go to **Item > Add Natural Attacks**. This adds all three automatically.

## Managing and editing weapons

You manage and edit melee or ranged weapons the same way you edit [Equipment](Equipment).

Weapon stats are controlled by the **Melee Weapon Usage** and **Ranged Weapon Usage** fields in the **Equipment Detail Editor**. For [Spells](Spells), these fields are available in the **Spell Detail Editor**.

To edit a weapon’s details:

- Open the weapon’s source item from the **Equipment list**, then edit its **Weapon Usage fields**.

> [!NOTE]
> A weapon must have at least one **default skill** (e.g., Broadsword, Spear) to calculate its skill level. See [Defaults](Defaults).
