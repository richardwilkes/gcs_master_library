# Scripting: Attribute

> [Return to the Scripting Guide.](../Scripting%20Guide)

This object represents a single Attribute.

Any attributes youâ€™ve defined for the sheet are available as globals using their ID prefixed with a dollar sign, e.g. `$st` refers to the Strength attribute. You can also access these via the [Entity](Entity).

For convenience, if you pass the attribute object as a value, it will resolve as if you had passed its maximum value. e.g. `$hp + 1` when the current HP is 8 with a maximum of 10, it would resolve to a value of 11 (10 + 1).
