**Tags** are short labels used to **categorize and filter items** across libraries and character sheets. You can assign tags to [Traits](Traits), [Skills](Skills), [Spells](Spells), and [Equipment](Equipment).

Tags make it easier to find related content in large libraries or when filtering by type. For example, viewing only _Melee Weapons_ or _Social Skills_.

## How tags work

Tags are:

- **Case sensitive:** `Combat` and `combat` are treated as different tags.
- **Comma-separated:** You can assign multiple tags to the same item (for example, `Physical, Athletic, Combat`).
- **User editable:** You can create your own tags for campaign-specific content or house rules.
- **Searchable and filterable:** In any library, use the **Any Tag** dropdown to filter results to specific categories.

## Adding and editing tags

To add or edit tags:

1. Open the item in its **Detail Editor** (for example, a Trait or Skill).
2. In the **Tags** field, enter one or more tags separated by commas.
3. Save your changes.

Once tags are added, you can use them to quickly group or search items across your libraries.

## Using tags in libraries

The **Any Tag** dropdown on a library toolbar lets you filter content by tag.

- Select a tag to show only items that match. Select and hold `Shift` or `Ctrl` on your keyboard to select multiple tags.
- Select **Any Tag** to clear the selection to show all items again.

Tags change depending on the library you are browsing.

For example:

- Filter Traits by `Advantage` or `Social` to narrow down your options.
- Filter Skills by `Combat`, `Social`, or `Technical`.
- Filter Equipment by `Weapon`, `Armor`, or `Tools`.

## Tag conventions

While you can create any tags you like, following common conventions helps keep things consistent, especially if you plan to [contribute to the Master Library](Contributing%20to%20the%20Master%20Library).

Here are some general patterns used in libraries:

- **Traits:** Use broad categories like `Advantage`, `Disadvantage`, `Physical`, `Mental`, `Social`, `Supernatural`.
- **Skills:** Tag by purpose or domain, such as `Combat`, `Social`, `Technical`, `Scholarly`, `Outdoor`, or `Cinematic Techniques`.
- **Spells:** Tag by college, such as `Air`, `Fire`, or `Mind Control`.
- **Equipment:** Tag by type or use, such as `Weapon`, `Shield`, `Armor`, `Medical Gear`, `Ammunition`, or `Tools`.
  - Some equipment also uses tags for identify which ammo the weapon uses, like `AmmoType:Arrow` or `UsesAmmoType:Sling`.

> [!TIP]  
> Consistent tag names make filtering and searching more powerful. Consider matching the tags already used in the Master Library when adding new items.
