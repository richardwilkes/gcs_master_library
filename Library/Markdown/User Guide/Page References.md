GCS supports **page references for GURPS books** to help you connect features in the tool to the corresponding GURPS rules and materials.

You can use page references to:

- Open a PDF to the specific page
- Look up a page in a physical book

## Book Abbreviations

For a list of official book abbreviations used in GCS, visit: https://gurpscharactersheet.com/page_references.html

Page references use a combination of the book abbreviation and page and follow this format: `abbreviation:page`

For example, `B16` references _GURPS Basic Set: Characters_, page 16.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the abbreviation includes a number, you must include a colon between the abbreviation and page. For example, `DF2:25` references _Dungeon Fantasy 2: Dungeons_, page 25.

## Page Mappings

If you own a PDF version of a book, you can map it to GCS and quickly open to the specific page from a page reference.

### Open a PDF

Once a PDF is mapped (see below), you can open it directly from a page reference:

- Select the page reference in GCS.

> [!NOTE]
> If your PDF opens to the wrong page, you may need to adjust the **page offset** under **Settings > Page Reference Mappings**.
> This accounts for things like covers, title pages, or other leading pages that affect numbering.

### Map a PDF

The first time you select an unmapped page reference, GCS will prompt you to map the PDF.

To map a PDF to a page reference:

1. Select an unmapped page reference in GCS.
2. Select **Yes** to create a mapping. Note the name of the suggested book.
3. In your file explorer, browse to the location of the PDF, select it, then select **Open**.

GCS will remember this mapping and use it automatically in the future for any page reference.

> [!TIP]
> You can map **any PDF** - such as house rules or custom supplements - to a page reference. This is useful for custom content you’ve added to your library. Just make sure your custom abbreviation doesn’t conflict with one of the book abbreviations listed below.

## Page Mapping Settings

To manage existing PDF mappings:

- Go to **Settings > Page Reference Mappings**.

From there, you can:

- Adjust the **page offset** to fix page numbering issues.
- **Edit** or **delete** existing mappings.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, PDFs open inside GCS. If you prefer to use your system's PDF viewer instead, you can change this under [General Settings](General%20Settings).
