You can add **Notes** to your [character sheet](Character%20Sheet%20Overview) for extra details, reminders, or references.

Notes are useful for:

- Campaign background and story notes.
- Notes for your gameplay.
- Quick rules references or house rules.

Notes always show their **full content** at the bottom of your character sheet (you don’t have to open them separately to read). Notes support **[Markdown](Markdown%20Guide)** and **Scripting** for formatting and automation.

## Adding notes

To add a note:

- Go to **Item > New Note**, or
- Right-click the Notes list and select **New Note**.

### Organizing notes with containers

Notes can be placed in [Containers](Containers) to group related notes or collapse long lists.

For example:

- A container for **House Rules** with several note entries inside.

## Deleting a note

To delete a note:

- Right-click it and select **Delete**, or
- Select it and go to **Edit > Delete**.

## Editing notes

You can edit a note in a few ways:

- Double-click it to open the **Detail Editor** for notes.
- Right-click it and select **Open Detail Editor**.
- Select a note and go to **Edit > Open Detail Editor**.

Type your notes directly in the **Notes** field.

Save your changes when you're done from the **Note Editor toolbar** (see below).
