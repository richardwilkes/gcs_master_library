The **Spell list** on your [character sheet](Character%20Sheet%20Overview) shows all of your character’s **spells** (p. B242), their levels, points spent, and notes on how they work.

GCS does **not** automate spellcasting. You must manually:

- Subtract **FP** (or **HP**) costs from your [Point pools](Point%20pools).
- Apply any effects or conditions from the spell to your character sheet.

You can add important reminders as [Notes](Notes), or use the [Page References](Page%20References) to jump directly to the rules in your PDF.

### Master Library

GCS includes hundreds of official spells in the **Master Library**. See [Library Explorer](Library%20Explorer) for more details.

You can also create your own custom spells.

## Spell list

The spell list on your character sheet includes the following columns. Select a column heading to sort ascending ![](./images/icons/icn-sortAscending.svg) or descending ![](./images/icons/icn-sortDescending.svg).

| Column                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **SL**                                        | The calculated skill level, based on its controlling attribute and points spent.                                                                                           |
| **Rsl**                                       | The relative skill level compared to its controlling attribute. For example, `IQ+2`.                                                                                       |
| **Pts**                                       | The total points you’ve invested in the spell.                                                                                                                             |
| **![](./images/icons/icn-pageReference.svg)** | Page reference for the skill. See [Page References](Page%20References) for more details.                                                                                   |
| **![](./images/icons/icn-source.svg)**        | Tracks whether the skill matches the official **Master Library**. See _Master Library Syncing_ in [Character Sheet Overview](Character%20Sheet%20Overview)                 |

## Adding spells

To add a spell:

1. Open a Spell library from the **Master Library**.
2. Choose the spell you want.
3. Add the spell in one of two ways:
   - Drag it from the library to your sheet, or
   - Right-click it and select **Copy to Character Sheet**.

You can also [create a new custom spell](Custom%20Content):

- On your character sheet, go to **Item > New Spell**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Many spells have [prerequisites](Prerequisites). If you add one without meeting its requirements, GCS shows an error below it. Hover over the error to see what’s missing.

When you add a spell:

- GCS highlights the block where it can be dropped. No matter where you drag it, it goes to the right location.
- The **Points block** updates automatically. Points spent on spells reduce your unspent points.
- The spell’s starting level is calculated automatically, based on its controlling attribute. Changing an attribute can change the skill level.
- **Ritual information:** Casting time, cost, and other ritual details (p. B237) are automatically calculated based on your spell level. These appear as notes under the spell on your character sheet.
- **Magery modifiers:** If your character has **Magery**, the appropriate modifiers are automatically applied to spells.

### Points and costs

- Most spells require at least **1 point** to purchase.
- Higher spell levels cost more points, based on the **Skill Cost Table** (p. B170).

## Managing spells

You can change spells on your sheet in a few ways.

### Incrementing points vs. increasing levels

**Increment:**

- Adds (or removes) **one point** at a time.
- Depending on the skill cost table (p. B170), several points may be required before the spell increases to the next level.

To add (or remove) points:

- Right-click the spell and select **Increment** (or **Decrement**), or
- Go to **Edit > Increment** (or **Decrement**).

**Increase Spell Level:**

- Raises (or lowers) the spell’s **actual level** directly.
- GCS automatically adds (or removes) the correct number of points based on the skill cost table.

To increase (or decrease) the spell level:

- Right-click the spell and select **Increase Skill Level** (or **Decrease Skill Level**), or
- Go to **Edit > Increase Skill Level** (or **Decrease Skill Level**).

> [!TIP]
> Use **Increment** when you’re tracking gradual training. Use **Increase Skill Level** if you want to jump directly to the next full level.

### Tracking study time

You can also track study time for spells. See [Study time](Study%20time) for more details.

> [!TIP]
> When tracking study time for spells, don’t forget that **Magery** reduces the required hours (p. B66). Update the **Standard learning hours** setting in the Study section to reflect this reduction.

### Organizing spells with containers

Spells can be grouped into [Containers](Containers) to keep related magic together.

For example:

- Group all **Fire College** spells into one container.
- You can also use containers when building [Character templates](Character%20Templates) to require a caster picks a certain number of spells.

### Deleting a spell

To delete a spell:

- Right-click it and select **Delete**, or
- Select it and go to **Edit > Delete**.

## Ritual Magic Spells

GCS also supports **Ritual Magic Spells**, which work similarly to standard spells but with a few differences:

- **Creating Ritual Magic Spells:**
  - On your character sheet, go to **Edit > New Ritual Magic Spell**.
- **Field differences:**
  - Ritual Magic spells include a **Base Skill** field. This is usually the _Ritual Magic_ skill, but you can select another if appropriate.
  - The **Difficulty** field is restricted to **Average (A)** or **Hard (H)**, per the Ritual Magic rules.
- **Automatic calculation:**
  - GCS automatically handles the math for Ritual Magic in the background, so you only need to enter the Base Skill and points.

Ritual Magic spells behave like standard spells. You can edit them, track study time, and manage them in the same way.

## Editing spells

You can edit a spells in a few ways:

- Double-click it to open the **Detail Editor** for spells.
- Right-click it and select **Open Detail Editor**.
- Select a spell and go to **Edit > Open Detail Editor**.

Save your changes when you're done from the **Spell toolbar** (see below).

## Spell Detail Editor fields

The Spell Detail Editor includes the following fields:
