In addition to the items included in the [Master Library](Library%20Explorer), you can create your own **traits, skills, spells, equipment, containers, and weapons**.

Custom content is useful when:

- You need a house-ruled trait, spell, or piece of gear.
- You want to save time by pre-building equipment sets or unique powers.
- You want to expand GCS with material not in the official libraries.

## Creating new items

To create a new custom item directly on your [character sheet](Character%20Sheet%20Overview).

1. Open your character sheet.
2. Go to **Item > New `<type>`** (for example, **New Trait**, **New Skill**, or **New Equipment**).
3. A blank item appears on your sheet.
4. Edit the item using the information on the relevant page:
   - [Traits](Traits)
   - [Skills](Skills)
   - [Spells](Spells)
   - [Equipment](Equipment)
   - [Containers](Containers)
   - [Melee and Ranged Weapons](Melee%20and%20Ranged%20Weapons)

You can customize new items further by adding [Defaults](Defaults), [Features](Features), [Trait Modifiers](Trait%20Modifiers), [Equipment Modifiers](Equipment%20Modifiers), and [Prerequisites](Prerequisites).

Save your changes when you're done.

> [!TIP]
> Start simple. For example, copy an existing skill from the Master Library and edit it instead of building one from scratch.

## Saving custom content

Custom items created on a character sheet are stored **only in that character** unless you save them to a library. To reuse your custom content across characters:

1. Go to **File > New `<type>` Library** to create a custom library (for example, **New Trait Library**)
2. Drag the item to your new custom library, then **save the library file** to keep it for future use.

Your libraries appear by default in your [User Library](Library%20Explorer).

Once saved, your custom items behave exactly like official ones:

- You can drag them into new characters.

If your content maybe useful for others, consider [Contributing to the Master Library](Contributing%20to%20the%20Master%20Library).
