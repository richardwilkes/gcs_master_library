**Equipment Modifiers** (p. B101 or B345) can be applied to [Equipment](Equipment) as either **enhancements** or **limitations**. These adjust the base cost and weight of items and allow you to add [Features](Features) to equipment.

### Master Library

GCS includes libraries of official Equipment modifiers in the **Master Library** that are taken from GURPS books and other supplements. See [Library Explorer](Library%20Explorer) for more details.

You can also create your own custom Equipment modifiers.

## Equipment Modifier list

The **Equipment Modifier** section in the Equipment Detail Editor includes the following columns. Select a column heading to sort ascending ![](./images/icons/icn-sortAscending.svg) or descending ![](./images/icons/icn-sortDescending.svg).

| Column                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                    |

## Adding Equipment modifiers

You must add modifiers to existing [Equipment](Equipment).

To add a modifier:

1. Open the **Equipment Detail Editor** for the Equipment you want to modify.
2. Open a Modifier library from the **Master Library**.
3. Drag the modifier to the **Equipment Modifier** section in the editor (note: you must drag it to the precise location on the Detail Editor).

You can also create a new custom modifier:

- Open the Equipment Detail Editor for the Equipment you want to modify.
- Go to **Item > New Equipment Modifier**.

## Managing modifiers

You can manage modifiers directly in the Equipment Detail Editor:

- **Enable/disable:** Check or uncheck the box to apply or remove a modifier’s effects.
- **Delete:** Right-click the modifier and select **Delete** (or select it and go to **Edit > Delete**).

## Editing Equipment modifiers

You can edit an Equipment modifier in a few ways:

- Double-click it to open the **Detail Editor** for Equipment modifiers.
- Right-click it and select **Open Detail Editor**.
- Select an Equipment modifier and go to **Edit > Open Detail Editor**.

Save your changes when you're done from the **Equipment modifier toolbar** (see below).

## Cost and Weight Modifiers

Unlike [Trait Modifiers](Trait%20Modifiers), equipment modifiers adjust an item’s **money cost** and **weight** instead of character points.

Each modifier has two parts:

1. A **value** (for example, `+5`, `-10%`, `×2`, `+1 CF`).
2. A **stage** (selected from the dropdown).

### Accepted formats

Both **Cost** and **Weight** modifiers accept multiple formats. You can enter **whole numbers, decimals, or fractions**:

- **Flat changes**: `+5`, `-5 lb`, `-0.2`
- **Percentages**: `+10%`, `-20%`
- **Multipliers**: `×2`, `×3.2`, `×2/3`
- **Cost Factor (CF)**: `+2 CF`, `-0.2 CF` (cost only, see below)

Cost Factor (CF) represents **multiplicative adjustments** to an item’s base price.

- A **positive CF** increases cost by adding multiples of the base price.
- A **negative CF** decreases cost by subtracting multiples of the base price.

For example, a $500 Broadsword with **+2 CF** (Fine quality) costs: `$500 base + ($500 x 2 CF) = $1,500`.

### Cost Modifier stages

- **To original cost:** Adjusts the raw book cost.
- **To base cost:** Adjusts after TL/CF changes.
- **To final base cost:** Adjusts after other modifiers, but before the final calculation.
- **To final cost:** Adjusts the very end result.

### Weight Modifier stages

- **To original weight:** Adjusts the listed book weight.
- **To base weight:** Adjusts after TL/CF changes.
- **To final base weight:** Adjusts after other modifiers, but before the final calculation.
- **To final weight:** Adjusts the very end result.

> [!TIP]  
> Multiple cost or weight modifiers can stack. Be careful which stage you apply them at — this changes the math significantly.
