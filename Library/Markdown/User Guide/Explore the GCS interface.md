When you open GCS, you’ll see its main window with three key areas that you’ll use often:

- **Menu bar:** Your main control center for commands and tools.
- **Library Explorer:** A hub for browsing and managing your lists.
- **Document Workspace:** Where your character sheets, lists, and other documents appear while you work on them.

## Menu bar

The Menu bar runs along the top of GCS and contains menus for most of the actions you can take.

It includes:

- **File:** Create, open, save, export, or print your character sheets and libraries.
- **Edit:** Copy, paste, duplicate, and perform other editing commands.
- **Item:** Create new traits, skills, spells, or equipment.
- **Settings:** Change GCS settings, sheet settings, and other customizations.
- **View:** Zoom in or out.
- **Window:** Manage how windows and tabs are arranged.
- **Help:** Access the About page, check for updates, and open the User Guide.

## Library Explorer

The [Library Explorer](Library%20Explorer) appears in the left sidebar and displays folders containing traits, skills, spells, and equipment, among other content.

It contains:

- **Favorites:** Items you've marked as favorites for quick access.
- **User Library:** Your personal collection of custom content.
- **Master Library:** The official library of lists aligned with GURPS books.

The **Library Explorer toolbar** gives you buttons to expand or collapse folders, create or delete a library or folder, update the Master Library, and manage favorites.

For more details, see [Library Explorer](Library%20Explorer).

## Document Workspace

The Document Workspace is where everything you open in GCS appears: character sheets, lists, PDFs, and settings.

### Windows

Each document opens in its own **window** inside the workspace.

You can:

- Resize windows by dragging the dividers
- Scroll horizontally or vertically within a window
- Maximize a window to fill the width of GCS:
  - Select **Maximize** ![](./images/icons/icn-windowMaximize.svg) on the top-right corner of the window.
  - Select **Restore** ![](./images/icons/icn-windowRestore.svg) to return to side-by-side view.

### Tabs

When you open multiple documents, each appears in its own **tab** within a window and has its own **toolbar** for relevant actions, such as searching and filtering. Tabs make it easy to switch between documents without closing them.

- **Unsaved Changes:** An asterisk (`*`) in a tab's name means the document has unsaved changes. Save to remove the asterisk.
- **Rearranging Tabs:** Drag tabs to reorder them within a window.
- **Moving Tabs Between Windows:** Drag a tab to another window to group documents together.
- **Splitting into New Windows:** Drag a tab away from the current window to create a separate one.
- **Docking Options:** While dragging, a highlight shows where the window will be placed: side-by-side, top, bottom, or any combination. This lets you customize your workspace layout.

> [!tip]
> Quickly close tabs by right-clicking:
>
> - **Close Other Tabs** closes all tabs except the one you clicked.
> - **Close All Tabs** closes every open tab in the window, including the one you clicked. This does not quit GCS.

## Next steps

Now that you’re familiar with the layout and tools, the next step is to [Create your first character](Create%20your%20first%20character).
