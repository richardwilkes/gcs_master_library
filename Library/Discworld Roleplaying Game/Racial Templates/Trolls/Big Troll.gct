					"userdesc": "Nonhuman or unusual characters may be larger or smaller than the human norm. This is represented by an abstract Size Modifier (SM). Any object can be assigned an SM to rate how hard it is to see from afar or hit in combat.\n\nNormal humans – from about 5’ to 6’6” in height – have an SM of 0. For other creatures and objects, consult this table:\n\nLongest Dimension   SM \n            2.5”               -9 \n            3.5”               -8 \n             5”                 -7 \n             7”                 -6 \n            10”                 -5 \n            18”                 -4 \n             2’                  -3 \n             3’                  -2\n            4’6”                -1\n            6’6”                 0\n             9’                  +1\n            15’                 +2\n            21’                 +3\n            30’                +4\n\nFor intermediate heights, use the next-higher value; e.g., 2’6” is SM -2. All this assumes an approximately human shape – just one long dimension. For an “elongated box” shape (e.g., a cart), add +1 to SM; for something like a cube or a sphere, add +2.\n\nA person with SM +1 or greater is easier to hit and may have problems fitting into rooms, vehicles, etc. meant for normal humans, but is often stronger and harder to kill than most humans. To reflect this, he gets 10% off the point cost of ST and HP per +1 SM (round all fractions up).\n\nSmaller-than-human characters (SM -1 or less) don’t modify these costs. The benefits and drawbacks of tiny size – such as being harder to hit but unable to use a lot of standard human gear – are considered to balance out. Such folk might have to take disadvantages that reflect their size, such as reduced Basic Move (p. 28) or Short Arms (p. 96), but that depends on the specific case.\n\nFinally, being larger is intimidating. When using Intimidation (p. 74), add your SM to your skill and subtract the target’s SM. However, you can’t get better than +4 this way; a 100’ giant isn’t that much more worrying than a 50’ giant. Also, many small beings on the Disc have better-than-human Will, Fearlessness, or the perk Unfazed by Size (p. 94).",

Subtract this from the damage done by any physical or energy attack after the DR of artificial armour but before multiplying the injury for damage type. This DR does not protect your eyes, or help against purely mental attacks like magical mind-blasts or elven hypnotism.\n\nOrdinary animals with natural armour can usually buy DR 1 to 5. Thick skin or a pelt would be DR 1; pig hide, armadillo shell, a heavy pelt, or scales like those of a lizard would be DR 2; rhinoceros hide would be DR 3; alligator scales or elephant hide would be DR 4; and a giant tortoise can have DR 5.\n\nTrolls and other siliconbased life forms – and golems – can purchase up to DR 8, although most have less. Odd supernatural beings, such as gods who’ve learned how to manifest as walking metal statues, might have more (GM’s decision).\n\nDamage Resistance usually costs 5 points/level but sometimes has flaws that reduce this cost:\n\nCan’t Wear Armour: Your body is designed in such a way that you cannot practically wear personal armour. Reduce cost by 2 points/level.\n\nOnly vs. X: Damage Resistance that only works against specific forms of attack has a price reduction, depending on how common the threat is. Two possibilities are “Only vs. Heat and Fire” (which also protects against lightning) and “Only vs. Impaling Damage”; both reduce cost by 2 points/level.\n\nTough Skin: Your DR isn’t rigid, leaving you vulnerable to being slowly squeezed or crushed. Furthermore, if a poisoned or drugged weapon, or some other exotic attack such as a stunning electrical blast, strikes your skin, the poison, drug, shock, etc., has full effect, even if your DR saves you from actual injury.

					"local_notes": "-Damage/(SM+2) to IQ and recover 1 level per second",
					"userdesc": "You’re a troll or similar, with a silicon brain which operates best in cold conditions. Your purchased IQ represents your intelligence in Chilly or Moderate temperatures (see Temperature Extremes, p. 191). This value falls as ambient temperatures rise.\n\nIn Warm conditions, you suffer -1 to IQ. This becomes -2 in a Hot environment, -3 in Very Hot temperatures, and -5 in Severe Heat. Intolerable Heat would cause you to turn even more thoroughly stupid! Your Will and Per – and all skills based on IQ, Will, or Per – are adjusted in line with your modified IQ.\n\nIf your effective IQ drops to 3 or 4, you can do little more than grunt and hit back if attacked; moreover, your DX and all DXbased skills are at -4. (Trolls in this condition generally lumber off into a corner and go to sleep.) At IQ 2, you run on pure instinct and can do nothing but shamble around at half Move until you find a place to fall over safely (most trolls consider falling on top of a human to be perfectly safe). In addition, at IQ 2 or less, you get no natural DR against heat-based damage, as your nervous system becomes highly vulnerable. At IQ 1 or below, you lock up and “turn to stone.” Old trolls can spend years like this – although at the GM’s option, they may respond to extreme provocation, running on the troll equivalent of adrenaline.\n\nHeat-based attacks (magical flame, incendiary weapons, etc.) cause shorter-lived penalties. Divide the attack’s damage roll by (2 + your SM), round down, and subtract the result from your IQ, even if no damage penetrates your DR; e.g., a troll with SM +2, hit by a fireball that rolls 15 points of damage, suffers -3 to IQ. You then recover a level of IQ per second. A salvo of small fireballs can thus heat you into temporary immobility, even if none of them really hurt. You may dislike very bright illumination, perhaps as a quirk (p. 66), because it’s associated with heat, but most urban trolls put up with the human preference for daytime. A few old-fashioned trolls might have an actual Dread (p. 95) of daylight.\n\nBalancing all this, you gain some benefits when the temperature is especially cool: Freezing conditions give a temporary +1 to IQ, Extreme Cold gives +2, and Intolerable Cold can grant even more, at the GM’s whim. If you’re locked in a magical freezer, you may gain genius-level insights into your situation – or the nature of the universe. This is left to roleplaying and GM discretion; the burst of advanced intelligence need not grant anything useful, and you might not know what to do with it. And be aware that even trolls suffer serious danger at these temperatures!\n\nIn a campaign which is set to take place mostly in cooler locations, Troll Brain is less of a disadvantage; the GM may reduce its point value. In a campaign set, say, in high mountains, trolls may be required to have higher “base” IQ scores than their usual racial template implies – that being their level in the usual local Freezing conditions – and get -5 points for Troll Brain, as they would remain vulnerable to fire attacks and unusually warm weather.",
