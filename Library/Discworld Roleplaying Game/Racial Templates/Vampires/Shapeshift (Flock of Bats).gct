					"reference": "DW27",
					"userdesc": "Nonhuman or unusual characters may be larger or smaller than the human norm. This is represented by an abstract Size Modifier (SM). Any object can be assigned an SM to rate how hard it is to see from afar or hit in combat.\n\nNormal humans – from about 5’ to 6’6” in height – have an SM of 0. For other creatures and objects, consult this table:\n\nLongest Dimension   SM \n            2.5”               -9 \n            3.5”               -8 \n             5”                 -7 \n             7”                 -6 \n            10”                 -5 \n            18”                 -4 \n             2’                  -3 \n             3’                  -2\n            4’6”                -1\n            6’6”                 0\n             9’                  +1\n            15’                 +2\n            21’                 +3\n            30’                +4\n\nFor intermediate heights, use the next-higher value; e.g., 2’6” is SM -2. All this assumes an approximately human shape – just one long dimension. For an “elongated box” shape (e.g., a cart), add +1 to SM; for something like a cube or a sphere, add +2.\n\nA person with SM +1 or greater is easier to hit and may have problems fitting into rooms, vehicles, etc. meant for normal humans, but is often stronger and harder to kill than most humans. To reflect this, he gets 10% off the point cost of ST and HP per +1 SM (round all fractions up).\n\nSmaller-than-human characters (SM -1 or less) don’t modify these costs. The benefits and drawbacks of tiny size – such as being harder to hit but unable to use a lot of standard human gear – are considered to balance out. Such folk might have to take disadvantages that reflect their size, such as reduced Basic Move (p. 28) or Short Arms (p. 96), but that depends on the specific case.\n\nFinally, being larger is intimidating. When using Intimidation (p. 74), add your SM to your skill and subtract the target’s SM. However, you can’t get better than +4 this way; a 100’ giant isn’t that much more worrying than a 50’ giant. Also, many small beings on the Disc have better-than-human Will, Fearlessness, or the perk Unfazed by Size (p. 94).",

If you take damage, this usually means that some of the component creatures were injured or killed.\n\nWhile in this form, you can fly at your Basic Speed x2 (just as for Flight, p. 89), and the swarm can in effect hover – although the creatures within it are doubtless moving all over the place. You have no ground movement, though; even if the component creatures have legs, coordinating them in that unfamiliar situation is just too confusing. You can also see in all directions at once, thanks to all those eyes. However, you don’t have much in the way of hands; you might be able to do a little with mouths, beaks, or claws (GM’s decision), but they aren’t made for manipulation and you find it impossibly complex to exert fine control over them. You probably have low ST; if so, you get the points for that separately.\n\nMost important, you’re extremely hard to injure seriously, as most attacks pass right through the swarm with a bit of squawking and fluttering. Impaling and piercing attacks never do you more than 1 HP of injury, while other attacks inflict at most 2 HP. The exception is area-effect attacks and explosions (usually the result of magic, alchemy, or really big rocks falling on you), which cause full damage.\n\nThis advantage is most often part of an Alternate Form (pp. 85- 87) template for vampires who have mastered the shapeshifting trick but still find themselves bound by tiresome conservation-ofmass limitations.
