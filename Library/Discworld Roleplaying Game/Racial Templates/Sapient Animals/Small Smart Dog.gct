					"reference": "DW27",
					"userdesc": "Nonhuman or unusual characters may be larger or smaller than the human norm. This is represented by an abstract Size Modifier (SM). Any object can be assigned an SM to rate how hard it is to see from afar or hit in combat.\n\nNormal humans – from about 5’ to 6’6” in height – have an SM of 0. For other creatures and objects, consult this table:\n\nLongest Dimension   SM \n            2.5”               -9 \n            3.5”               -8 \n             5”                 -7 \n             7”                 -6 \n            10”                 -5 \n            18”                 -4 \n             2’                  -3 \n             3’                  -2\n            4’6”                -1\n            6’6”                 0\n             9’                  +1\n            15’                 +2\n            21’                 +3\n            30’                +4\n\nFor intermediate heights, use the next-higher value; e.g., 2’6” is SM -2. All this assumes an approximately human shape – just one long dimension. For an “elongated box” shape (e.g., a cart), add +1 to SM; for something like a cube or a sphere, add +2.\n\nA person with SM +1 or greater is easier to hit and may have problems fitting into rooms, vehicles, etc. meant for normal humans, but is often stronger and harder to kill than most humans. To reflect this, he gets 10% off the point cost of ST and HP per +1 SM (round all fractions up).\n\nSmaller-than-human characters (SM -1 or less) don’t modify these costs. The benefits and drawbacks of tiny size – such as being harder to hit but unable to use a lot of standard human gear – are considered to balance out. Such folk might have to take disadvantages that reflect their size, such as reduced Basic Move (p. 28) or Short Arms (p. 96), but that depends on the specific case.\n\nFinally, being larger is intimidating. When using Intimidation (p. 74), add your SM to your skill and subtract the target’s SM. However, you can’t get better than +4 this way; a 100’ giant isn’t that much more worrying than a 50’ giant. Also, many small beings on the Disc have better-than-human Will, Fearlessness, or the perk Unfazed by Size (p. 94).",

When reading, roll vs. IQ just to get the basic meaning. 1 point for spoken, 1 point for written.\nAccented: You can communicate clearly. You’re only at -1 when using skills that depend on language. 2 points for spoken, 2 points for written.\nNative: You use the language as well as a native. 3 points for spoken, 3 points for written\n\nSkill penalties are doubled (to -6 or -2) for artistic skills when beauty and subtlety are required; e.g., for composing poetry.\nNative-level comprehension of your native language is free. Being less literate in that language is a disadvantage: -1 point for Accented (a passable writing style, but with some bizarre spelling and punctuation), -2 points for Broken (sometimes called “semi-literacy”), or -3 points for None (illiteracy). Poor or nonexistent literacy is widespread in barbarian societies and among trolls, and the GM may choose not to count it against the campaign disadvantage limit (if any).\nWhen describing characters, assume by default that they write languages as well as they speak them; somebody described simply as having Klatchian (Accented) speaks and writes Klatchian at Accented level (and probably paid 4 points for this). If they don’t write as well as they speak, or vice versa, the description should give two levels; the first defines how well they speak the language, the second is how well they write it. For example, many trolls in Ankh-Morpork have Morporkian (Accented/None), for 2 points; they can chat quite well to locals, in distinctly trollish tones, but they’re completely illiterate in the language. A more complicated example might be somebody with Uberwaldian (Broken/Native), for 4 points; this person has perhaps learned to write fluent and chatty letters to acquaintances in Uberwald, but if he ever tries talking to them, he mangles the pronunciation and trips over his tongue.",
