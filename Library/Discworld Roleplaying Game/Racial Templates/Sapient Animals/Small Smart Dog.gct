					"reference": "DW27",
					"userdesc": "Nonhuman or unusual characters may be larger or smaller than the human norm. This is represented by an abstract Size Modifier (SM). Any object can be assigned an SM to rate how hard it is to see from afar or hit in combat.\n\nNormal humans – from about 5’ to 6’6” in height – have an SM of 0. For other creatures and objects, consult this table:\n\nLongest Dimension   SM \n            2.5”               -9 \n            3.5”               -8 \n             5”                 -7 \n             7”                 -6 \n            10”                 -5 \n            18”                 -4 \n             2’                  -3 \n             3’                  -2\n            4’6”                -1\n            6’6”                 0\n             9’                  +1\n            15’                 +2\n            21’                 +3\n            30’                +4\n\nFor intermediate heights, use the next-higher value; e.g., 2’6” is SM -2. All this assumes an approximately human shape – just one long dimension. For an “elongated box” shape (e.g., a cart), add +1 to SM; for something like a cube or a sphere, add +2.\n\nA person with SM +1 or greater is easier to hit and may have problems fitting into rooms, vehicles, etc. meant for normal humans, but is often stronger and harder to kill than most humans. To reflect this, he gets 10% off the point cost of ST and HP per +1 SM (round all fractions up).\n\nSmaller-than-human characters (SM -1 or less) don’t modify these costs. The benefits and drawbacks of tiny size – such as being harder to hit but unable to use a lot of standard human gear – are considered to balance out. Such folk might have to take disadvantages that reflect their size, such as reduced Basic Move (p. 28) or Short Arms (p. 96), but that depends on the specific case.\n\nFinally, being larger is intimidating. When using Intimidation (p. 74), add your SM to your skill and subtract the target’s SM. However, you can’t get better than +4 this way; a 100’ giant isn’t that much more worrying than a 50’ giant. Also, many small beings on the Disc have better-than-human Will, Fearlessness, or the perk Unfazed by Size (p. 94).",

Poor or nonexistent literacy is widespread in barbarian societies and among trolls, and the GM may choose not to count it against the campaign disadvantage limit (if any).\nWhen describing characters, assume by default that they write languages as well as they speak them; somebody described simply as having Klatchian (Accented) speaks and writes Klatchian at Accented level (and probably paid 4 points for this). If they don’t write as well as they speak, or vice versa, the description should give two levels; the first defines how well they speak the language, the second is how well they write it. For example, many trolls in Ankh-Morpork have Morporkian (Accented/None), for 2 points; they can chat quite well to locals, in distinctly trollish tones, but they’re completely illiterate in the language. A more complicated example might be somebody with Uberwaldian (Broken/Native), for 4 points; this person has perhaps learned to write fluent and chatty letters to acquaintances in Uberwald, but if he ever tries talking to them, he mangles the pronunciation and trips over his tongue.",

Loss of a second leg causes you to fall down.\n\nYou have no “hands” more agile than paws or hooves. Consequently, you cannot use your limbs to make repairs, pick locks, wield weapons, etc., or even to grasp firmly. This gets you a 40% discount when improving ST (p. 26) and DX (p. 26), however.\n\nYour build doesn’t let you put your full weight behind a kick; your thrusting damage is at -1 per die when kicking. Ignore this if you have Claws (p. 88) – that trait includes the necessary adaptations to strike at full power. The penalty does apply if you have Hooves, however.",
