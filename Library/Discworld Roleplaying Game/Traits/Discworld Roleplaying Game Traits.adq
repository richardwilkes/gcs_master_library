Scores above 20 are possible but typically reserved for superhuman beings – ask the GM before buying such a value. At the other end of the scale, 1 is the minimum score for a human. Your decisions here will determine your most fundamental strengths and weaknesses throughout the game. Choose wisely:\n\n6 or less: Crippling. An attribute this bad severely constrains your lifestyle.\n7: Poor. Your limitations are immediately obvious to anyone who meets you. This is the lowest score you can have and still pass for “able-bodied.”\n8 or 9: Below average. Such scores are limiting but within the human norm.

							"userdesc": "The point cost to learn an additional language depends on your “comprehension level” – a measure of how well you function in that language overall. There are four such levels:\n\nNone: You don’t know the language at all. 0 points.\nBroken: You know just enough to get by in daily life, but have -3 when using skills that depend on language. When reading, roll vs. IQ just to get the basic meaning. 1 point for spoken, 1 point for written.\nAccented: You can communicate clearly. You’re only at -1 when using skills that depend on language. 2 points for spoken, 2 points for written.\nNative: You use the language as well as a native. 3 points for spoken, 3 points for written\n\nSkill penalties are doubled (to -6 or -2) for artistic skills when beauty and subtlety are required; e.g., for composing poetry.\nNative-level comprehension of your native language is free. Being less literate in that language is a disadvantage: -1 point for Accented (a passable writing style, but with some bizarre spelling and punctuation), -2 points for Broken (sometimes called “semi-literacy”), or -3 points for None (illiteracy). Poor or nonexistent literacy is widespread in barbarian societies and among trolls, and the GM may choose not to count it against the campaign disadvantage limit (if any).\nWhen describing characters, assume by default that they write languages as well as they speak them; somebody described simply as having Klatchian (Accented) speaks and writes Klatchian at Accented level (and probably paid 4 points for this). If they don’t write as well as they speak, or vice versa, the description should give two levels; the first defines how well they speak the language, the second is how well they write it. For example, many trolls in Ankh-Morpork have Morporkian (Accented/None), for 2 points; they can chat quite well to locals, in distinctly trollish tones, but they’re completely illiterate in the language. A more complicated example might be somebody with Uberwaldian (Broken/Native), for 4 points; this person has perhaps learned to write fluent and chatty letters to acquaintances in Uberwald, but if he ever tries talking to them, he mangles the pronunciation and trips over his tongue.",

In game terms, characters have no penalty to operate socially in cultures they understand – but in ones where they’re strangers, they’re in danger of making unfortunate or catastrophic errors, such as eating with the wrong hand or speaking to the wrong person. The Cultural Familiarity (CF) trait represents proper understanding of a culture. Each distinct culture has its own CF.\n\nCharacters are assumed to be comfortable with their “native” culture for free. Record this under “Cultural Familiarities”; e.g., “Klatchian [0].” Familiarity with other cultures costs 1 point per culture. If you don’t have CF for the culture in which you’re trying to operate, you’re at -3 to the skills Carousing, Dancing, Detect Lies, Diplomacy, Directing, Fast-Talk, Gesture, Heraldry, Leadership, Politics, Public Speaking, Savoir-Faire (all forms), Streetwise, and Teaching. This penalty extends to Acting if the GM decides that the act requires cultural background knowledge; to Criminology when dealing with criminal behaviour rather than methods; to Performance, Poetry, and anything else artistic when trying to emulate a local style; and to Intimidation and Sex Appeal when used as Influence skills (pp. 74-75).\n\nCultures are defined broadly; minor local differences don’t make a different culture. On the Disc, “contemporary” Cultural Familiarities include Sto Plains/Uberwald (covering everything from the Circle Sea through Ankh-Morpork to Lancre and beyond, and also such colonies and cultural outliers as Genua, Fourecks, and even Krull), Agatean (the formal, ancient culture of the Counterweight Continent), and Klatchian (actually the culture of the desert-dwelling peoples of the hubward edge of the great continent of Klatch, generally applicable in most neighbouring countries, too), along with surviving distinct local cultures in countless remote regions. Most adventurers should be able to get away with taking no more than two or three CFs, but those who want to spend long periods in remote communities may have to learn more – and games set in slightly earlier periods might feature distinct CFs for virtually every nationstate around the Circle Sea (Djelibeybi, Ephebe, Tsort, etc.).",

Bigger Congregations than this are out of PC territory. A Congregation always has a frequency of appearance (above) of 15 or less; this is already factored into the point cost.

Still, they’ll defend themselves if attacked (unless you’re the sort of priest or god who attracts fanatical pacifists).

							"name": "Status",
							"userdesc": "Status is the primary measure of social standing. Levels range from -2 to 8, with an ordinary citizen being Status 0. If you don’t\nspecifically buy Status, you have Status 0. Status costs 5 points per level; e.g., Status 5 costs 25 points, while Status -2 is -10 points. High Status costs money to support, so you’ll probably need high Wealth (pp. 33-34) to go with it.\n\nStatus greater than 0 means you’re a member of the dominant classes. Consequently, others in your culture only defer to you, giving you a bonus on all reaction rolls equal to the difference between your Status and theirs; e.g., a Status 2 merchant reacts to a Status 5 duke at +3. However, criminals and street rabble may hate the upper classes, and react to them at large penalties if they can get away with it (GM’s option). Some figures, such as witches and Hubland monks, see themselves as standing outside normal hierarchies, so Status is unlikely to influence their reactions either way. A high-Status character will normally treat somebody of lower but non-negative Status with distant politeness (no reaction modifier), but gaffes can quickly turn differences into penalties for the lower-Status person; e.g., if that merchant did something actively annoying to the duke, the duke would remember the difference between them and react at -3.\n\nHowever, Status less than 0 means you’re definitely of the lower orders. Higher-Status characters will often react to you at a penalty equal to the difference in level, although they’ll tolerate your existence so long as you seem to know your place. Alternatively, they may carefully ignore you.\n\nAll of which said, Discworlders are often a remarkably democratic lot, considering that most of them are traditionalist monarchists. Much of the time, they only really acknowledge four social categories: Proper Gentlefolk (to whom other people are polite out of tradition or fear), Nouveau Riche (about whom people are often quite rude in private, but who have the power to purchase at least a working facsimile of respect), the Supernatural Lot (wizards, witches, and priests, who are a bit weird but who might be able to turn you into a frog, so be careful), and Everyone Else (common folk). For dealings within a single category, the GM can safely ignore fine gradations of Status except when portraying nitpicking snobs or inverted snobs.\n\nThe Status Table shows what each Status level typically signifies. “Monthly Cost” is the cost of living at that Status level; it keeps you alive and looking the part. If you can’t raise the money to match your Status each month, then you must live in a style that you can afford – and so you’ll be treated as having lower Status than you’ve paid the points for. (If you can’t make Status -2 expenses, you’re literally starving to death on the street.) If you live below your nominal Status for more than a couple of months, you’ll probably have to do something impressive to restore your credibility later (give a good party, say, or acquire a big house). If your Status comes partly or entirely from Rank (see Special Cases for Status, p. 38), then the salary attached to that Rank will generally be enough to support it – but your lifestyle may be somewhat circumscribed by the job. See Living Expenses (pp. 148-149) and Characters With Jobs (p. 173) for more on all this.",

The Ankh-Morpork City Watch has Watch Rank (p. 256), and other cities are doubtless imitating that structure as they imitate Ankh-Morpork generally. Formal, powerful religions have hierarchies with Religious Rank (p. 302). The governing bureaucracy of the Agatean Empire has Administrative Rank; other Discworld bureaucracies aren’t sufficiently structured and disciplined to count as having a Rank structure – although in Ankh-Morpork, the Patrician’s palace and the Post Office may both come close.\n\nIf you have high Rank, you can order those of lower Rank to assist you – but only for purposes related to the organisation.

Special agents may be granted special powers – but rulers with the authority to set that up also tend to arrange matters so that the agent is left to dangle in the wind if the mission goes wrong. You need to be exceptionally well regarded by a powerful ruler to qualify",

Only one authority – e.g., your temple, a guild court, or the king – can judge or punish you. If the rules that govern your behaviour are merely different from ordinary law, but just as strict, this costs 5 points. If they’re less strict, it’s 10 points. And if you can do nearly anything you please provided that you don’t injure your group’s long-term interests, pay 15 points\n\nLegal Immunity is usually accompanied by high Status (pp. 37-38), Clerical Investment (p. 34), and/or a Duty (pp. 59-60). Wizards at Unseen University don’t have this advantage, although they theoretically claim a degree of immunity to civil law, because civil law is patchily and informally enforced in Ankh-Morpork anyway, and a wizard who breaks the rules can expect much the same consequences as anyone else. Members of the Assassins’ and Thieves’ Guilds do have the 5-point version, however, because while the Watch will try to stop assassinations and a lot of non-contractual thievery, the chance of a Guild member being tracked down and brought to justice is pretty low. On the other hand, both are subject to their respective guilds’ rules.\n\nA special version of this is available to Igors (pp. 140-141):",

					"userdesc": "You’re magically adept. This advantage comes in levels. You must purchase Magery 0 (for 5 points) before buying higher levels (for another 10 points apiece).\n\nThis is basic “magical awareness”: a prerequisite for learning “proper” magic. It’s said that people with this ability have octagons as well as rods and cones in their eyes, enabling them to perceive octarine, the eighth colour of the spectrum, the “colour of magic” – but that may be a metaphor or something.\n\nThe GM makes a Sense roll (pp. 169-170) when you first see a magic item, and again when you first touch it. On a success, you intuitively know that the item is magical. A roll of 3 or 4 also tells you whether the magic is helpful or dangerous, and about how strong it is. With a similar roll, you sometimes get a “sense” about other supernatural things, though never any details; for instance, you might notice that a werewolf is “strange,” but that’s all. Individuals without Magery don’t get these rolls.\n\nIn addition, you can operate certain magical items – relatively safely and reliably, even – because you can sense the operational energies, read the invisible control runes, or whatever. You can also sense that invisible spirits (such as ghosts) are around, although you can’t locate them; you just get “a feeling.” And you usually perceive beings using the Unnoticed advantage (p. 48), as you’re used to seeing what’s truly there and aren’t so easily persuaded to ignore things.\n\nFurther levels of Magery make it much easier to learn and use magic. Add your Magery to your IQ when you learn Magic, Magical Form, and Thaumatology skills (and also spells, if the GM uses the optional rule on p. 203). For instance, if you have IQ 14, Magery 3 lets you learn those skills as though you had IQ 17. As well, your Magery level adds to Perception when you roll to sense magic items and beings, and it may benefit some rolls required when operating magical devices. Finally, higher Magery levels grant you access to more powerful spells and let you channel more energy into certain “variable” magics; see pp. 195-196.",

Moreover, you get +1 per level to Magic skill and all Magical Form skills (pp. 202-217), so long as you’re holding the staff.\n\nThe drawback is that the staff can be snatched away from you by an opponent. First, he has to use a grab attack (pp. 183-184) to get hold of it. Then he must win a Regular Contest of ST to take it from you. Fortunately, he can’t then turn it against you, even if he’s a wizard (see below).\n\nYou can take up to three levels of this advantage. There are legends of more powerful staffs, but they’re true one-offs, with built-in problems you wouldn’t want to know about. The only one to appear in the chronicles was carried by Coin the Sourcerer, which says it all.\n\nNormally, you can only purchase Superior Staff at character creation. Acquiring it once you’ve started a career in wizardry is a tricky and lengthy process at best. The traditional method for ruthless wizards is to take such a staff off another wizard (usually implying something homicidal). To benefit from this, you must then spend one month “detuning” your old staff and two months per level “attuning” to the new one, during which time you can’t do much else. Other wizards who realise what you’ve done will despise you if they have any morals, and envy you bitterly if they don’t.",

					"userdesc": "You have the ability to not be noticed by normal people. This isn’t true invisibility – light doesn’t pass through you, and a fair number of beings can see you just fine – but it serves. This is basically what Death himself uses as he goes about his job. However, it doesn’t work – or at least not well – against anyone who’s accustomed to seeing things that “aren’t supposed to be there.”\n\nYou can turn this ability on and off at will with a one-second Concentrate manoeuvre. It works not only for you but also for anything you’re carrying up to Heavy encumbrance (p. 168). People get a chance to notice you, though, which requires a successful Will roll at -5. They try automatically when you first enter their view after at least five minutes out of their sight, or when you turn on your ability in their presence, and may be allowed to try again if you make loud noises, do something violent, etc., at the GM’s discretion. If you physically attack someone, your victim gets a roll to notice in time to defend himself, and automatically notices you after being hit once. Optionally, the GM can give very small children a bonus of +1 to +5 to all of these Will rolls, as they haven’t always learned to ignore inconvenient truths yet.\n\nUnnoticed fails automatically against gods, spirits, and anyone with any version of See Invisible (p. 46). Individuals with Magery (pp. 44-45) or Medium (p. 45) aren’t immune, but they roll at +2 to Will instead of at -5 (having both advantages doesn’t give a double bonus), and enjoy an additional +2 per Magery level; e.g., someone with Magery 0 or Medium rolls at Will+2, Magery 1 gives Will+4, and Magery 3 gives Will+8. If someone like this succeeds three times against you, your ability will never again work on him!\n\nThis supernatural advantage is mostly associated with a job as some kind of anthropomorphic personification, such as Death or a Tooth Fairy. Indeed, it “comes with the job”; anyone accompanying Death on his rounds, or standing in for him, gains the full benefits of his ability (under his control, if he’s present), while Tooth Fairies – who are perfectly ordinary young women in most respects – gain the ability while they are at work.

Issuing the command requires a one-second Concentrate manoeuvre (p. 176) – or longer, if the GM thinks it’s complicated enough. Then roll a Quick Contest between your IQ and each possible victim’s Will. If you win, that person must obey; if he wins, he’s immune to your ability for the next 24 hours.\n\nThe effect will last anywhere from one second for a nighsuicidal instruction (“Attack that army!”) to a minute or two for something which the victim might well do anyway (“Give the doggy a biscuit.”). If the command is one which requires an extended duration, assume that it persists for up to a minute per point by which you won the Quick Contest.\n \nTo make your Voice of Command more effective, you can buy bonuses to your IQ roll. Every +2 to your roll costs 5 points. If the advantage affects only specific categories of victim, the GM might reduce its cost by 5 to 25 points, depending on how much this constrains the ability. For example, “Only affects humans” would be worth -5 points, “Only on trolls” or “Only on males” would be -10 points, and “Only affects redheads” would be -25 points.\n\nThis is a supernatural trait, but one or two slightly supernatural beings in the stories have acquired it. Gaspode the Wonder Dog (pp. 316-317) gains it because people assume that anything they hear from a talking dog must actually be their own idea.

Killing a target’s guards, let alone mere servants, is questionable manners; it can be forgiven in exceptional circumstances, but it’s a matter for stern self-criticism, as bypassing guards with stealth and agility is always preferable. Never employ gross or clumsy methods; you disdain explosives in any great quantity (a small charge, perfectly placed, might show just enough style), or heavy weapons. Offer a personal service; you might possibly deal with two or three problems at the same time, but you refuse bulk orders. Nor will you shoot down a victim in the street like a crude thug; you deliver at home or at the office, and always leave a receipt. Wear black or very dark colours, unless there’s some clear off-duty reason not to; this inspires respect (and helps you hide in shadows, although solid black isn’t perfect for that), but it can also attract the attention of lower-class persons who regard killing an Assassin as something to boast about.",

					"userdesc": "You take pride in following a set of “honourable” principles. The specifics can vary. You’ll do nearly anything, maybe even risk death, to avoid looking “dishonourable.”\n\nThe point value of a Code of Honour depends on how much trouble it gets you into, and on how arbitrary and irrational its requirements are. An informal Code, or one that shouldn’t ever get you killed, is worth -5 points. A formal Code, or one that often sends you into danger, is worth -10 points. A highly formal Code that regularly jeopardises your life is worth -15 points.\n\nMany social classes and groups have an associated Code of Honour. This doesn’t necessarily mean that all or even most such people actually possess the disadvantage – although highminded and idealistic ones usually will, and many others may follow it at quirk level (p. 66), obeying it when convenient but not at serious risk to their lives. On the other hand, openly disregarding your group’s Code is a good way to become a social outcast; a “gentleman” who fails to act the part may be expelled from his club and possibly sent far away by his family, while a watchman who doesn’t watch his colleagues’ backs may find his gear vandalised and can’t expect much help when he gets into trouble. Failing to pay lip-service to a Code can be the basis for a negative Reputation (p. 34).\n\nAs the Disc is a realistic-comedy world, many people who espouse strict Codes come across as stiff-necked, pompous, and even stupid. However, the sincere ones get credit for trying – and there are those who believe that sometimes, when Narrative Causality (pp. 8-9) kicks in, living by one of the stricter Codes can save your life. The hero will win, but only if he acts like a hero; the dark lord will live to scheme another day, but only if he plays his part. Certainly, a Code may well mean allowing opponents a better chance provided that they played by the rules as well, whether this is a soldier treating prisoners better if they, too, recognise the Soldier’s Code, or a dark lord putting a proper barbarian hero in a fallible death-trap when he’d outright massacre mere rebellious peasants.
