Their hair is thick and wavy, and can be any color from platinum blonde\r to jet black. Red hair is almost unknown, but vivid blue or green tresses are\r common. Merfolk eyes are always vivid blue or green. Their fish-halves are\r covered with glistening scales of blue and green, and their tails are forked.\r Their upper bodies are proportioned normally for their ST, but they weigh 30%\r more than normal.\r "

Merfolk do not wear clothes, but do like to wear decorations of coral,\r shell or plant matter. They often wear equipment harnesses of fishgut or\r seaweed."
