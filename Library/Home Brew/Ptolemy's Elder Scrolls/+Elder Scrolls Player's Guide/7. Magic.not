In game terms, all magic uses the Ritual Magic system, adapted for the High Mana world of *The Elder Scrolls*. There are no Powerstones and no Manastones.\n\n### Ritual Magic Core\nThe core skill of the magic system is Thaumatology. No Ritual Magic College skill can be greater than Thaumatology.\n\nAll spells are Hard Techniques that default to one of seven Ritual Magic College skills.\n\nThe Seven Colleges:\n- Alteration - Spells that manipulate the laws of nature.\n- Conjuration - Spells that summon creatures and equipment from other worlds.\n- Destruction - Spells that cause physical harm.\n- Enchantment - The ability to add magical effects to clothing, armor, weapons, and other items.\n- Illusion - Spells that alter perception.\n- Mysticism - Spells that shape and focus ethereal forces.\n- Restoration - Spells that heal.\n\n### Defaults and Limits\n- Each spell defaults to its governing College skill at a penalty equal to the spell’s prerequisite count.\n- No Ritual Magic skill can exceed Thaumatology.\n- No Ritual Magic skill defaults to any other skill.\n\n### Casting Spells with Magery\n- If you have Magery, your spell skill cannot exceed its governing College skill.\n- The **Specialty Magic Mastery** talents can further boost spells within their college. This is the only way for those with Magery to exceed their College skill. Note that these talents are for GURPS **Magic** colleges, which can cover spells split between different *The Elder Scrolls* Colleges. You can find them in the **Elder Scrolls Traits** library.\n\n### Casting Spells without Magery\nIf you do not have Magery, you may still cast spells! You must pay for the spell as normal, and you must have at least 1 point in Thaumatology and the spell's Ritual Magic College skill. You may improve a spell up to a maximum skill level of 12 by buying levels of the **Spell Focus** perk (see the **Elder Scrolls Traits** library and the **Traits and Skills** section of the **Elder Scrolls Player's Guide** for more details). This allows a non-mage to learn a spell and be able to cast it fairly reliably, though the non-mage will not be able to get the cost or time reductions that come with knowing a spell at skill level 15. A Thief may want to know the spells Lockmaster or Invisibility while a Warrior may want to know Haste or Minor Healing.\n\n### Magicka Points\nSpells are fueled by Magicka Points instead of the Fatigue Points used in standard GURPS. If a spellcaster is out of Magicka Points, he can use Fatigue Points or Health Points to power his spells, but he pays 3 FP or 3 HP for every one required MP. This means the spellcaster will become exhausted or injured very quickly for casting beyond his MP reserves.\n\n### Learning Spells\n- You do not need to invest points in individual spells to cast them. However, you must purchase each spell to know it.\n- Cost = (Prerequisite Count + 1) x $50\n- This represents the cost of instruction, scrolls, practice reagents, and access to libraries or mentors.\n\n## Spell Libraries and Changes\nAll valid spells have been updated and organized in the **Elder Scrolls Spells** library. Every new spell has its full description written in its Notes section and is tagged with “The Elder Scrolls” for easy reference.\n\n### New Spells\nThese spells have been added to reflect iconic *Elder Scrolls* magic:\n- Summon Undead / Daedra - Conjures spirits or Daedric entities for limited durations.\n- Bound Weapons / Armors - Summons powerful Daedric weapons or armor.\n- Soul Trap – Allows the caster to capture the soul of a defeated creature in a soul gem.\n- Almsivi / Divine Intervention - Teleports the caster (and his companions for additional MP) to the nearest Tribunal Temple or Imperial Cult shrine. GMs may add new versions of these to suit gameplay in different regions of Tamriel, or may remove them entirely.\n- Mark / Recall - Allows the caster to set and return to a personal anchor point. GMs who do not want to allow players to teleport may remove these spells.\n- Fortify Life / Magicka / Stamina - Temporarily boosts the respective attribute.\n- Frost Armor - Creates a shell of cold resistance and minor protection, akin to Fire or Lightning Armor.\n- Minor / Major / Great Restore Stamina - Restores Fatigue using Magicka.\n\n### Modified Spells\nSeveral core GURPS spells have been adjusted to better fit the setting’s mechanics and tone:\n- Resist Acid / Cold / Fire / Lightning - Now grant Damage Resistance (DR) instead of total immunity.\n- Recover Energy - Restores Magicka Points (MP) instead of Fatigue Points (FP).\n- Invisibility - Uses the **Dungeon Fantasy** variant rules for the spell.\n- Create Gate - Renamed to Create Oblivion Gate. It is used to open a gate from Mundus to one of the realms of Oblivion, or, if cast in a realm of Oblivion, it can create a gate to another Oblivion realm or to Mundus. It is up to the GM if this spell can be cast multiple times to travel from one place in Tamriel to another.\n\n### Removed Spells\nThe following categories of spells have been removed, as they conflict with *Elder Scrolls* lore or mechanics:\n- Teleportation Spells - Replaced by Mark/Recall and Divine/Almsivi Intervention.\n- Time Spells - Manipulating time is beyond most mortal magic in this setting.\n- Missile Shield / Reverse Missiles - Removed due to the absence of “Meteoric Iron” or other anti-magic materials. Blocking spells like Deflect Missiles or Ward should be used instead.\n- Hawk Flight - Removed for balance reasons.\n- Great Haste - Removed for balance reasons.\n- Bless / Curse - Removed because they don't fit the setting.\n- All Technology spells - Removed because they don't fit the setting.\n- Power - Not used in the Enchanting system. See the Enchanting section of the Player's Guide for details.\n\nAs always, the GM is free to add, remove, or modify spells to best suit his game."
