His work provided both the inspiration and the foundation for this adaptation. Many of the core ideas here follow his approach, refined and expanded with my own modifications. I consider this project a continuation and evolution of the groundwork he laid.\n\nI also want to thank everyone who offered advice, feedback, and encouragement during development - and especially my play testers, whose patience and creativity helped turn rough mechanics into a playable system. My thanks to Cleopatra, graesheep, Esa Lord, ScionofGaul, Based Cosmo, Telchar, Ethanrat, Exxar, Neck, Ryoki, Savar, Zen Druid, Viridianus, LinX, Aro, Atomic Fox, Supernaut, RainyDayNinja, and Jaso11111.\n\nYou can find me on Discord at Ptolemy1. I’m happy to make this material freely available to all GURPS and Elder Scrolls fans. If you like it and want to say thanks, you can buy me a coffee here: www.buymeacoffee.com/Ptolemy1"
