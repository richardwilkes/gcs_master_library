Unless otherwise noted, skills function as described in ***GURPS Basic Set***, with the following changes and additions to better reflect the world and mechanics of *The Elder Scrolls*.\n\n## General Skill Changes\n\n### Alchemy\nAlchemy is a Hard skill rather than a Very Hard one. It completely replaces Herb Lore, which is not used in this setting. All knowledge of gathering, identifying, and using alchemical ingredients is handled through Alchemy. Any references to Herb Lore in other ***GURPS*** material used alongside this setting should instead use Alchemy.\n\n### Animal Handling\nAnimal Handling gains several new specialties reflecting the unusual fauna of Tamriel:\n- Insectoids: Used for creatures such as Kwama, Stilt Striders, and Chaurus. This specialty is also used to control Stilt Striders, rather than Riding or Teamster.\n- Netch: Used for Bull and Betty Netch.\n- Pachyderms: Used for Mammoths.\n- Reptilians: Used for Guar, Kagouti, Alits, and other reptilian creatures.\n\n### Diagnosis\nDiagnosis functions as normal, but defaults to Esoteric Medicine instead of Physician.\n\n### Esoteric Medicine\nEsoteric Medicine fully replaces Physician, which should not be used in this setting. All advanced medical treatment beyond basic First Aid is handled through Esoteric Medicine.\n\n### Hidden Lore\nHidden Lore includes an expanded list of setting-specific specialties. The GM may add, remove, or restrict specialties as appropriate for the campaign, and players should consult with the GM before taking Hidden Lore specialties beyond Daedra and Undead.\n\nCommon specialties include, but are not limited to, Akavir, Ayleids, Daedra, Dragons, Dwemer, Higher Mysteries, Hist, Magic Items, Magic Writings, Undead, and Yokuda.\n\n### Poisons\nPoisons functions normally, but defaults to Alchemy at -3 instead of Physician, which is not used in this setting.\n\n### Riding\nRiding gains the specialty Reptilian, used for riding Guar, Kagouti, Alits, and other reptilian mounts. In regions where such creatures are common, this specialty typically replaces Riding (Equines).\n\n### Survival\nSurvival gains two additional specializations:\n- Ashlands: Used for volcanic and ashen regions such as those surrounding Red Mountain in Vvardenfell. This specialty defaults to other Survival specializations at -3.\n- Subterranean: Used for caves and other underground environments, including Dwemer ruins and ancient crypts. Subterranean and other Survival specializations default to each other at -4.\n\n## Magic Skills\nThe following skills underpin the Ritual Magic system used in this conversion.\n\n### Thaumatology\nThaumatology serves as the core skill for Ritual Magic. No Ritual Magic skill may exceed the character’s Thaumatology skill before situational or temporary modifiers are applied.\n\n### Ritual Magic Skills\nThere are seven Ritual Magic skills, each corresponding to one of the Tamrielic schools of magic:\n\n- Alteration  \n- Conjuration  \n- Destruction  \n- Illusion  \n- Restoration  \n- Mysticism  \n- Enchantment  \n\nThese skills govern spellcasting within their respective schools and replace the standard ***GURPS*** college skills.\n"
