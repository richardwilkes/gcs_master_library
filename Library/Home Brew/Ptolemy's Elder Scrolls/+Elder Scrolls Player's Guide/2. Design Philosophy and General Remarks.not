When multiple versions of a mechanic or feature existed, I generally leaned toward the *Morrowind* interpretation.\n\nThis material is not intended to be a tutorial for either ***GURPS*** or *The Elder Scrolls*. It assumes a working familiarity with both the system and the setting, and players new to either will benefit from prior exposure. Most of the ***GURPS*** mechanics used here are drawn directly from ***GURPS Basic Set***, ***GURPS Low-Tech***, ***GURPS Martial Arts***, ***GURPS Magic***, and the ***GURPS Dungeon Fantasy*** line, with minimal re-explanation. The focus is on adaptation and integration rather than instruction.\n\nThe goal of this project is to create a ***GURPS*** game that feels like *The Elder Scrolls*, not a perfect recreation of the video games. Characters earn and spend character points just as they do in standard ***GURPS***, and the ***GURPS Magic*** spell list is used even when it contains spells never seen in *The Elder Scrolls*, such as Body of Air or Iron Arm, because these spells are thematically appropriate. Always keep in mind that *The Elder Scrolls* games were designed as video games, and many spells, powers, and mechanics are optimized for video gameplay rather than tabletop play.\n\nThis system is designed as a modification of ***GURPS Dungeon Fantasy***, which shares many of the same assumptions as *The Elder Scrolls*: adventurers based out of a town or guildhall, pursuing contracts and quests, delving into ruins, caves, and wild places, and returning to spend their earnings, advance their skills, and acquire better equipment. In general, you should use *Dungeon Fantasy* assumptions, such as Talents being limited to 6 levels instead of 4, as well as the usual expectations for finding work and opportunities in settled areas.\n\nIf you find certain features jarring or incompatible with your preferred era or tone, such as Mark and Recall, Levitation, or other older-style spells, feel free to restrict or remove them. The same applies to the spell list overall: it is largely the ***GURPS Magic*** spell list, with selected additions, removals, and adjustments to better reflect Tamriel’s world and lore.\n\nUltimately, the GM should always feel empowered to change, alter, or ignore any part of these rules to better fit their table. This content is meant to be a flexible framework, not a constraint, for bringing *The Elder Scrolls* to life in ***GURPS***.\n\nIf the GM or a player ever has questions about *The Elder Scrolls* lore, the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (UESP Wiki) are an invaluable reference.\n\n## The Bestiary\n\nThe **Elder Scrolls Bestiary** contains stat blocks for many of the unique enemies found throughout *The Elder Scrolls*. These range in difficulty from the humble Scrib to the devastating Ash Vampire. Each entry includes a brief descriptive note, the creature’s soul tier if captured using a Soul Trap spell, and whether the creature can carry diseases. The GM is encouraged to modify these creatures as needed to best suit the game.\n\n## Why Magicka Points?\n\nThe decision to use Magicka Points instead of Fatigue Points or an alternate resource such as Quintessence is meant to better reflect the spirit of *The Elder Scrolls*. In the source material, Magicka is a distinct pool of energy separate from physical stamina. By keeping these resources apart, spellcasting becomes more mechanically practical and appealing, and characters no longer have to sacrifice endurance or combat effectiveness to use magic.\n\nIn this system, a character’s Magicka Points function as an Energy Reserve equal to IQ. This gives dedicated mages a larger pool of energy than in standard ***GURPS Magic***, allowing them to cast more freely and better resemble their counterparts in the games. At the same time, it provides non-mages with a meaningful resource for powering enchanted items or casting spells through the Spell Focus perk. The result is a magic system that feels familiar to *The Elder Scrolls* players while remaining consistent with ***GURPS*** mechanics.\n\n## Why Ritual Magic?\n\nRitual Magic was chosen as the foundation of the magic system to best reflect how spells function in *The Elder Scrolls* while keeping play manageable for both players and GMs. In the source material, mages have access to a wide range of spells without strict prerequisite chains. Their ability to wield more powerful magic depends on skill rather than having mastered simpler spells first. Ritual Magic mirrors this structure naturally: spells are techniques that become easier to use as a caster’s mastery of a magical college improves.\n\nWhile some players prefer alternatives such as Sorcery or Ritual Path Magic, these systems introduce significant complexity and shift away from the feel of *The Elder Scrolls*. Sorcery treats spells as individually purchased powers, limiting a mage’s repertoire and making experimentation costly, while also requiring substantial design effort from players or GMs. Ritual Path Magic, though flexible and evocative, demands extensive GM adjudication and introduces mechanics that do not align well with the setting, such as improvised spells, charms, and prolonged energy-gathering rituals. Both systems would require heavy modification to support *The Elder Scrolls*-style spellcasting, where mages cast rapidly from fixed spell lists and rely on large Magicka reserves.\n\nRitual Magic, by contrast, aligns cleanly with the feel of *The Elder Scrolls* magic while keeping gameplay fast and intuitive. It allows spells to vary in power, area, or duration, with each adjustment affecting Magicka cost, much like in the games. While it does not support fully custom spells to the extent seen in *Daggerfall*, *Morrowind*, or *Oblivion*, it comes close, particularly through spells such as Link, which allow creative combinations of effects.\n\nThere are practical benefits as well. Using ***GURPS Magic*** as the base system simplifies Enchanting and Scroll creation, avoiding the need for complex item-construction systems such as Meta-Tech. It also supports an in-world economy for learning spells, allowing characters to spend gold rather than character points to expand their magical knowledge, encouraging exploration and adventure.\n\nIn short, Ritual Magic captures both the mechanics and the spirit of *The Elder Scrolls* spellcasting. It rewards skill, preserves simplicity, and provides the depth needed for satisfying magical gameplay without burdening players or GMs with excessive complexity.\n"
