Tamriel, the main landmass where all *Elder Scrolls* games take place, is a mature TL4, replete with technology like plate armor, advanced mills, and ocean-going ships. However, firearms are not present. If the GM wishes to include old Dwemer firearms or a cannon from *The Elder Scrolls: Redguard*, he is free to. However, by default, they should not appear, as they violate the feel of the setting.\n\n### Character Points and Balance\nCharacters are built on 250 points by default, following the assumptions of **Dungeon Fantasy**. This represents experienced adventurers who are capable, specialized, and ready to make their mark. GMs can adjust this total to suit the tone of their campaign.\n\n### Magicka Points (MP)\nMagicka Points (MP) represent a character’s pool of mystical energy and are used to cast spells. Every character begins with MP equal to their IQ score. MP functions like Fatigue Points for spellcasting but is tracked separately. There is no upper limit to how much MP a character can possess.\n\nMP recovers in the same ways that FP does, and the Recover Energy spell restores MP instead of FP. MP can also be replenished through potions, by absorbing spells, or by making a donation of at least $50 at a shrine. Shrines are commonly found in towns and cities, and sometimes in the wilderness or within ancient tombs.\n\nCharacters born under the sign of The Atronach cannot recover MP through rest. They may only restore it using potions, absorbing spells, or visiting shrines.\n\nPlayers using the **Blank TES Character Sheet** in the library will find MP already included alongside HP and FP.\n\n### Race and Birthsign\nRacial templates are required and define the character’s innate traits and cultural roots. Birthsigns are optional but encouraged, offering flavorful bonuses that reflect Tamrielic lore. The most expensive Race + Birthsign combinations cost 100 points, which is why the Class templates are all 150 points. Cheaper combinations simply allow more points to be spent on customization. These can be found in the **Elder Scrolls Races** and **Elder Scrolls Birthsigns** libraries.\n\n### Classes\nClass templates are built on 150 points and draw from the classes in *Morrowind* and *Oblivion*. Each class provides a focused mix of attributes, advantages, and skills for a distinct playstyle. Despite similarities among classes, each has small distinctions in focus and feel. As in the Elder Scrolls games, classes should remain entirely optional. They serve best as guides or inspiration for building a unique adventurer, rather than as restrictions on creativity. Classes are found in the **Elder Scrolls Classes** library. Note that, if you use Classes, you may find listed optional traits that cost more than the Class allows - this is because characters with cheaper Races or Birthsigns may have extra points they can spend, and the trait fits the Class' theme."
