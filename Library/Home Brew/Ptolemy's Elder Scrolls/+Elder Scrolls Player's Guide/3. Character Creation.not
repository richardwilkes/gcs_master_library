Players can spend points for cash, with each point giving $1,000. GMs can lower this number if they feel it is too high.\n- The world is High Mana, meaning anyone can cast spells, even without Magery.\n- Choose a Race (required) and a Birthsign (recommended).\n- Add a Class Template or build your character from scratch.\n- The maximum level for any Talent is 6.\n- If you gain the same trait from multiple sources, combine the levels and spend any excess points however you wish.\n\n- The **Blank TES Character Sheet** is configured to support character creation in this setting.\n\n## Setting\n\nThe world of *The Elder Scrolls* is a High Mana setting, meaning that anyone can cast spells, even without Magery. Tamriel, the primary landmass where the *Elder Scrolls* games take place, is a mature TL4 society, featuring technologies such as plate armor, advanced mills, and ocean-going ships.\n\nFirearms are not normally present. If the GM wishes to include old Dwemer firearms or a cannon from *The Elder Scrolls: Redguard*, they are free to do so, but such weapons should be considered unusual. By default, firearms are excluded, as they tend to undermine the intended tone and feel of the setting.\n\n## Character Points and Balance\n\nCharacters are built on 250 points by default, following the assumptions of ***GURPS Dungeon Fantasy***. This represents experienced adventurers who are capable, specialized, and ready to make their mark on the world. GMs may adjust this total upward or downward to suit the desired tone of the campaign.\n\n## Magicka Points (MP)\n\nMagicka Points (MP) represent a character’s pool of mystical energy and are used to cast spells. Every character begins with MP equal to their IQ score. MP functions like Fatigue Points for spellcasting but is tracked separately, and there is no upper limit to how much MP a character may possess.\n\n### Recovering MP\n\nMP recovers in the same ways that FP does, and the Recover Energy spell restores MP instead of FP. MP can also be replenished through potions, by absorbing spells, or by making a donation of at least $50 at a shrine. Shrines are commonly found in towns and cities, and may also appear in the wilderness or within ancient tombs.\n\n### The Atronach Exception\n\nCharacters born under the sign of *The Atronach* cannot recover MP through rest. They may only restore MP by using potions, absorbing spells, or visiting shrines.\n\nPlayers using the **Blank TES Character Sheet** will find MP already included alongside HP and FP.\n\n## Race and Birthsign\n\nAll characters must select a racial template, which defines their innate traits and cultural background. Birthsigns are optional but strongly encouraged, providing distinctive bonuses rooted in Tamrielic lore.\n\nThe most expensive Race and Birthsign combinations cost up to 100 points. For this reason, Class templates are built on 150 points. Cheaper Race or Birthsign choices leave additional points available for customization. Racial templates and Birthsigns can be found in the **Elder Scrolls Races** and **Elder Scrolls Birthsigns** libraries.\n\n## Classes\n\nClass templates are built on 150 points and are inspired primarily by the classes found in *Morrowind* and *Oblivion*. Each Class provides a focused mix of attributes, advantages, and skills suited to a particular playstyle. While many Classes share similarities, each has small but meaningful distinctions in emphasis and flavor.\n\nAs in the *Elder Scrolls* games, Classes are entirely optional. They function best as guides or starting points rather than restrictions. Players are always free to modify a Class or build a character without using one at all.\n\nClasses are available in the **Elder Scrolls Classes** library. Some Classes list optional traits whose total cost exceeds the Class’s point value; this allows characters with cheaper Races or Birthsigns to spend excess points on traits that still fit the Class’s theme.\n"
