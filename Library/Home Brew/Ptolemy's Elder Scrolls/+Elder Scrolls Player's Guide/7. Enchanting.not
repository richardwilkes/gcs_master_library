Minor charms, trinkets, and utility items can be found in many settlements, while powerful enchanted arms and legendary artifacts are exceedingly rare and command staggering prices.\nEnchanting is the art of binding magical effects into physical objects by channeling the power of captured souls. Unlike most forms of magic, an enchanter does not expend their own energy during the process; instead, the soul contained within a Soul Gem provides all of the power required to fuel the enchantment.\nIn general, enchanting follows the rules described in ***GURPS Magic***, with the setting-specific changes described below. All enchanted items, soul gems, and scroll templates are provided through GCS libraries rather than listed exhaustively here.\n\n### Using Enchanted Items\nAnyone may use enchanted items, whether mage or non-mage. Whenever a spell description in ***GURPS Magic*** states that an enchanted item may only be used by mages, that restriction is ignored for this setting.\n\n### Souls and Soul Gems\nSouls are the vital essence of living beings and the foundation of all enchanting. By using the Soul Trap spell or an enchanted weapon bearing that effect, an enchanter may capture the soul of a recently slain creature and bind it within a Soul Gem.\nSouls are divided into five tiers based on the creature’s point value:\n- Petty: Less than 0 points  \n- Lesser: 1–100 points  \n- Common: 101–200 points  \n- Greater: 201–300 points  \n- Grand: 301+ points  \n\nSoul Gems come in matching tiers. A Soul Gem of a higher tier may hold a soul of a lower tier, but each gem may contain only a single soul. Once a soul is used to power an enchantment, the Soul Gem is destroyed.\nYou cannot capture the soul of a summoned creature in a Soul Gem.\nEach tier of soul provides a fixed amount of enchantment energy and a Power rating, matching the scale used by the Power spell in ***GURPS Magic***, though the spell itself is not used:\n- Petty: 250 energy, Power 1  \n- Lesser: 500 energy, Power 2  \n- Common: 2,000 energy, Power 3  \n- Greater: 4,000 energy, Power 4  \n- Grand: 8,000 energy, Power 5  \n\nAs a result, no standard enchantment may require more than 8,000 energy. Artifacts and unique relics may exceed this limit at the GM’s discretion.\n\n### The Enchanting Process\nIn addition to a Soul Gem, enchanting requires a monetary investment based on the total energy of the enchantment.\nEnchanting an item yourself costs $5 per point of energy.\nCommissioning an NPC enchanter, such as the Mages Guild, costs more depending on the size of the enchantment:\n- Up to 250 energy: $10 per point  \n- 251–500 energy: $15 per point  \n- 501–2,000 energy: $20 per point  \n- 2,001–4,000 energy: $25 per point  \n- 4,001–8,000 energy: $30 per point  \n\nNPC enchanters are assumed to be highly competent. They typically do not fail enchantments, and should only roll if circumstances are rushed, hostile, or extraordinary. If an NPC enchanter does fail, the cost of the enchantment is refunded, and part of the value of the destroyed item may also be refunded at the GM’s discretion.\n\n### Skill and Difficulty\nTo enchant an item, the caster must know both the Enchant spell and the specific spell being placed into the item at skill 10 or higher.\nApply a penalty of -1 to effective skill for every full 1,000 energy in the enchantment. An enchantment of 500 energy has no penalty, while an enchantment requiring 6,250 energy applies a -6 penalty.\nRoll for the enchantment only once, at the end of the process, against the lower of Enchant or the spell being enchanted. The GM rolls this check in secret.\nOn a failure, the Soul Gem and its contained soul are destroyed. On a critical failure, the item itself may also be damaged or destroyed, at the GM’s discretion. No form of Luck, including Super Luck, may be used on an enchantment roll.\n\n## Scrolls\nScrolls are single-use magical items inscribed with a pre-cast spell, ready to release its power when read aloud. Unlike enchanted items, scrolls are simple to use and require no innate magical ability.\nAnyone may activate a scroll. When used, the scroll releases its stored spell exactly as written, using the skill level of its creator. The user expends no MP and cannot modify the spell’s effect, increase its energy, or alter its parameters. All required energy is already infused within the scroll, making its magic entirely self-contained.\n\n### Creating Scrolls\nCreating a scroll follows the general rules for Scroll in ***GURPS Magic***, with the following changes:\n- Anyone who knows the necessary spells may craft a scroll, even characters without Magery.\n- The time required is 1 hour per point of energy, rather than 1 day per point.\n- The creator spends the MP that the scroll will use when it is activated.\n- The cost to create a scroll is $30 per point of energy.\n- The cost to purchase a scroll is $50 per point of energy.\n- The creator must know both the Scroll spell and the spell being inscribed at skill 10 or higher.\n- The creator rolls once against the lower of the two spells. No form of Luck, including Super Luck, may be used. The GM rolls in secret.\n\nOn a failure, the scroll is ruined and the cost of materials is lost. On a critical failure, the scroll will backfire when used, producing a magical backlash or miscast effect determined by the GM.\nOnce inscribed, a scroll retains its magic indefinitely. When activated, the spell is cast and the scroll disintegrates.\n\n### Examples\n- A 3d Fireball scroll: contains 3 energy, cost to make: $90, cost to buy: $150. \n- A Haste scroll, granting +3 Move/Dodge for 3 minutes: contains 12 energy, cost to make: $360, cost to buy: $600. \n- A Scroll of Divine Intervention that can teleport the caster and three other subjects: contains 18 energy, cost to make: $540, cost to buy: $900.\n"
