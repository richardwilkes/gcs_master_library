A wide variety of potions and their effects are available in the **Elder Scrolls Equipment** library. GMs are encouraged to use those entries alongside potions from other ***GURPS*** sources, such as ***Dungeon Fantasy*** or ***GURPS Magic***, as appropriate.\nAlchemy in this setting is intentionally abstracted. Reagents are tracked by tier rather than as individual ingredients, allowing alchemy to remain flexible, fast, and easy to adjudicate at the table while still rewarding skill and preparation.\n\n## Cost and Reagents\nThe cost to brew a potion is 60% of its retail value. All reagent requirements are based on this creation cost, not on the potion’s sale price.\nReagents are divided into three tiers:\n- Common\n- Rare\n- Exotic\n\nReagents are tracked as abstract pools by tier rather than as individual ingredients. Whenever reagent values are calculated or spent, always round to the nearest whole dollar.\nTo brew a potion, the alchemist must spend at least 75% of the potion’s creation cost in reagents of the potion’s tier or higher. The remaining 25% may come from lower-tier reagents. Higher-tier reagents may always substitute for lower-tier reagents, but lower-tier reagents may never substitute for higher-tier ones.\n*Example*:  A Rare potion with a creation cost of $600 requires $450 worth of Rare or Exotic reagents, plus $150 worth of reagents of any tier.\n\n## Potion Tiers\nPotion effects, such as Restore HP, Resist Fire, or Flight, are divided into three tiers tied to reagent rarity:\n- Common\n- Rare\n- Exotic\n\nIn addition, each potion is brewed at one of three potency tiers:\n- Standard\n- Quality\n- Exquisite\n\nPotions in the **Elder Scrolls Equipment** library are tagged by effect tier. Potency is chosen at the time of brewing and affects both difficulty and cost.\n\n## Brewing Potions\nTo brew a potion, the GM rolls once against the character’s Alchemy skill. The potion’s effect tier and potency tier impose penalties to this roll.\nEffect Tier Penalties:\n- Common: no penalty\n- Rare: -2\n- Exotic: -4\n\nPotency Tier Penalties:\n- Standard: no penalty\n- Quality: -2\n- Exquisite: -4\n\nThese penalties stack. Brewing a potion with a Rare effect at Quality potency applies a total penalty of -4.\nOn a failure, the reagents are wasted.  \nOn a critical failure, the alchemist believes the potion succeeded, but it instead produces an unintended, harmful, or reversed effect, determined by the GM when the potion is consumed.\nNo form of Luck, including Super Luck, may be used on Alchemy rolls.\n\n## Brewing Time\nA potion requires brewing time equal to its retail value in minutes. A potion worth $300 requires 300 minutes (5 hours) to brew.\nThe alchemist must personally attend the brew for at least half of this time.\n\n## Multiple Effects\nA potion may contain up to four effects.\nTo calculate cost and difficulty:\n- Add the base creation cost of all effects together.\n- Increase the total cost by 50% for each additional effect beyond the first.\n- Apply a -3 penalty to the Alchemy roll for each additional effect beyond the first.\n\nEach effect must independently meet its reagent tier requirements.\n*Example*: A potion combining one Rare effect and one Common effect has a combined base cost of $800. Because it has one additional effect, increase the cost by 50% to $1,200. Since one effect is Rare, the potion must include at least $900 worth of Rare or higher reagents.\nThe Compounding Alchemist perk reduces the penalty for additional effects from -3 per effect to -1 per effect.\n\n## Potion Tolerance\nDrinking multiple potions in quick succession is physically taxing. Whenever a character consumes more than one potion within ten minutes, he must roll against HT −2 or become Nauseated (B428) for minutes equal to Margin of Failure × 5.\nThis roll is modified by traits such as Fit, Very Fit, Unfit, and High Pain Threshold.\nCharacters with Alchemy 12 reduce this penalty to 0.  \nCharacters with Alchemy 14 gain a +2 bonus to the HT roll.\nThe Potion Tolerance perk grants an additional +2 bonus. This stacks with the bonuses above, allowing master alchemists to consume multiple potions with minimal risk.\n\n## Gathering Reagents\nReagents may be gathered from the environment using the Alchemy or Naturalist skills. A character guided by someone with Alchemy or Naturalist at skill 14 or higher may instead roll Survival −3. Characters using Survival must have at least one point in the appropriate Survival specialization and may not default from another specialization.\nEach gathering attempt takes two hours. A character may make no more than one gathering roll per week in the same area. Characters may take extra time to gain bonuses to their gathering roll.\nEach environment has a baseline reagent value per gathering attempt and a fixed percentage split between Common, Rare, and Exotic reagents.\nTo determine the total haul:\n- Final haul = Baseline × (100% + 20% per Margin of Success, or −40% per Margin of Failure)\n- Minimum haul is 0\n\n*Example*: Denborn gathers reagents in a Swampland, which has a baseline reagent value of $300. He rolls Naturalist and succeeds with a MoS 2, the haul is worth $420. With a split of 60% Common, 30% Rare, and 10% Exotic, the alchemist gathers $252 of Common reagents, $126 of Rare reagents, and $42 of Exotic reagents.\nOn a critical success, up to 25% of the final haul is upgraded one tier. Upgrade Common to Rare first, then Rare to Exotic, until 25% of the haul has been upgraded or no eligible reagents remain.\n*Example*: Veros gathers reagents in an Arctic environment, and he rolls a critical success with a MoS of 10, resulting in a 200% increase over the baseline value of $200 for a new total of $600. His critical success alters the standard percentage split for the region: the new split is 40% Common reagents, 45% Rare reagents, and 15% Exotic reagents. He gathers $240 of Common reagents, $270 of Rare reagents, and $90 of Exotic reagents.\nOn a critical failure, the character gathers nothing and faces a serious setback or dangerous encounter, at the GM’s discretion.\nRound reagent totals to whole dollars at the end of all calculations.\n\n## Reagents by Region\nEach region lists its baseline reagent value per gathering attempt and the percentage split between reagent tiers.\n- Arctic: $200; 70% Common / 25% Rare / 5% Exotic  \n- Desert: $180; 60% Common / 30% Rare / 10% Exotic  \n- Island/Beach: $250; 75% Common / 20% Rare / 5% Exotic  \n- Jungle: $320; 50% Common / 35% Rare / 15% Exotic  \n- Mountain: $240; 65% Common / 30% Rare / 5% Exotic  \n- Plains: $270; 80% Common / 20% Rare / 0% Exotic  \n- River/Lake: $280; 70% Common / 25% Rare / 5% Exotic  \n- Swampland: $300; 60% Common / 30% Rare / 10% Exotic  \n- Woodlands: $270; 75% Common / 20% Rare / 5% Exotic  \n- Ashlands: $250; 40% Common / 40% Rare / 20% Exotic  \n- Subterranean: $220; 50% Common / 35% Rare / 15% Exotic  \n- Daedric Ruin: $300; 30% Common / 40% Rare / 30% Exotic  \n- Oblivion: $350; 20% Common / 40% Rare / 40% Exotic  \n- Urban: $180; 90% Common / 10% Rare / 0% Exotic\n"
