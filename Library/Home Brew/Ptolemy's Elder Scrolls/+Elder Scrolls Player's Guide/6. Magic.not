From the blessings of the Divines to the conjurations of guild mages and the hedge-spells of travelers and thieves, magic is understood as a disciplined art governed by learnable laws—powerful, dangerous, and deeply shaped by culture and tradition.\nIn game terms, this setting uses the Ritual Magic system from ***GURPS Basic Set*** as the foundation for all spellcasting. This approach emphasizes structured study, magical theory, and individual spells as practiced techniques rather than free-form improvisation. The system has been adapted to reflect the High Mana nature of *The Elder Scrolls*, with Magicka as the primary fuel for spellcasting and with spell lists, colleges, and limitations tailored to Tamrielic lore.\nEvery spell available in the game can be found in the **Elder Scrolls Spells** library, including both core and newly added spells.\n\n## The Basics of Magic\nAt the foundation of all magic is Thaumatology. This skill represents a character’s understanding of magical theory: the metaphysical principles that explain why magic works and how it can be shaped. Thaumatology acts as the governing skill for all other magical study.\nNo Ritual Magic College skill may ever exceed a character’s level in Thaumatology before situational or temporary modifiers are applied.\nBelow Thaumatology are the Ritual Magic Colleges. Each College represents focused training in a particular approach to magic. These skills reflect broad competence within a magical discipline rather than mastery of specific spells.\nEvery spell belongs to exactly one Ritual Magic College. Spells are treated as Hard Techniques that default to their governing College skill. A spell’s prerequisite count determines how difficult it is to perform relative to that College, representing the complexity of the technique rather than a chain of required spells. Ritual Magic College skills do not default to Thaumatology or to any other College skill.\nA character must understand the theory (Thaumatology), practice the discipline (College skill), and then learn the technique (the spell itself). Improving a spell without improving its College represents specialization, while improving the College reflects broader magical competence.\n\n## Magic and High Skill\nHigh spell skill provides reduced casting times and reduced Magicka costs as described in ***GURPS Magic***, with one important exception: all spells require some amount of physical gesture as a ritual, however slight. A high skill level will never fully eliminate the need for gesture to cast spells.\n\n## The Seven Colleges\nTamrielic magic is traditionally divided into seven Colleges:\n- Alteration: Spells that manipulate the laws of nature.\n- Conjuration: Spells that summon, bind, or banish creatures and objects from other realms.\n- Destruction: Spells that cause physical harm through elemental or force-based effects.\n- Enchantment: The imbuing of objects with magical properties.\n- Illusion: Spells that alter perception, emotion, and awareness.\n- Mysticism: Spells that shape and focus ethereal forces and arcane structures.\n- Restoration: Spells that heal, fortify, purify, and ward against harm.\n\n## Defaults and Limits\n- Each spell defaults to its governing College skill at a penalty equal to the spell’s prerequisite count.\n- No Ritual Magic College skill may exceed Thaumatology before situational or temporary modifiers.\n- Ritual Magic College skills do not default to Thaumatology or to any other College skill.\n\n## Casting Spells with Magery\nMagery represents formal magical aptitude and training.\nIf you have Magery, your base skill with a spell may not exceed its governing Ritual Magic College skill. Characters with Magery may exceed their College skill for specific spells only by purchasing Specialty Magic Mastery talents.\nNote that Specialty Magic Mastery talents are defined by ***GURPS Magic*** colleges, which may overlap multiple *Elder Scrolls* Colleges. Specialty Magic Mastery talents can be found in the **Elder Scrolls Traits** library.\n\n## Casting Spells without Magery\nMagery is not required to cast spells in this setting. A character without Magery may cast spells as long as they:\n- Pay the full monetary cost to purchase the spell,\n- Have at least 1 point in Thaumatology, and\n- Have at least 1 point in the spell’s governing Ritual Magic College skill.\nNon-mages may improve individual spells by purchasing levels of the **Spell Focus** perk. This allows a character to raise a spell’s skill up to a maximum of 12. This represents rote learning and practical familiarity rather than deep magical understanding.\nWhile this allows a non-mage to cast spells fairly reliably, it comes with important limitations. Without Magery, a character cannot achieve the high spell skill needed to reduce Magicka cost or casting time. As a result, non-mages are best suited to learning a small number of highly practical spells rather than building a broad magical repertoire. This supports archetypes common to *The Elder Scrolls*, such as warriors who know a healing spell or thieves who rely on Invisibility or Lockmaster.\n\n## Magicka Points\nSpells in this setting are powered by Magicka Points (MP) rather than the Fatigue Points (FP) used in standard ***GURPS***.\nWhen a spellcaster casts a spell, they pay its cost in MP. MP recovers normally at the same base rate that FP does.\nIf a spellcaster runs out of MP, they may still cast spells by drawing on physical reserves. The caster may spend FP or HP to make up the difference, paying 3 FP or 3 HP for every 1 MP required, chosen at the time of casting. This represents forcibly channeling magic through the body rather than through Magicka alone. Casting spells this way is extremely dangerous and is intended for last-ditch spellcasting rather than routine use.\n\n## Learning Spells\nYou do not need to invest character points into individual spells in order to cast them. However, you must purchase each spell to know it. This purchase represents instruction, access to written sources, supervised practice, experimentation, and the time required to master a safe and repeatable technique.\nThe cost to learn a spell is:\nCost = (Prerequisite Count + 1) × $50\nThis expense covers tutors, spell manuals, reagents consumed during practice, access to libraries or guild facilities, and other resources required to learn the spell. The GM may require appropriate in-world access to magical instruction or allow characters to learn spells during downtime between adventures.\n\n### Spell Libraries and Changes\nAll spells used in this setting are organized in the **Elder Scrolls Spells** library.\nNew spells introduced by this conversion are tagged **The Elder Scrolls**. To view only newly created spells, filter the spell list by the **The Elder Scrolls** tag and read each spell’s Notes for full descriptions and special rules.\n\n## Newly Added Spells\nThis conversion adds spells to reflect iconic *Elder Scrolls* magic.\n- Summon Undead and Summon Daedra\n- Bound Weapons, Bound Armor, and Bound Shield\n- Soul Trap\n- Almsivi Intervention and Divine Intervention\n- Mark and Recall\n- Fortify Life, Fortify Magicka, and Fortify Stamina\n- Frost Armor\n- Minor Restore Stamina, Major Restore Stamina, and Great Restore Stamina\n- Cure Blight Disease\n\n## Modified Spells\n\nSome core ***GURPS Magic*** spells exist in this setting but function differently in order to better match *The Elder Scrolls* tone, metaphysics, and balance assumptions. Full spell text and any special notes are provided in the **Elder Scrolls Spells** library.\n- Resist Acid / Resist Cold / Resist Fire / Resist Lightning: These spells grant Damage Resistance (DR) against the relevant damage type rather than total immunity. This reflects the prevalence of elemental magic in Tamriel and keeps powerful elemental threats meaningful while still rewarding defensive preparation.\n- Recover Energy: This spell restores Magicka Points (MP) instead of Fatigue Points (FP), because MP is the primary energy resource for spellcasting in this setting.\n- Invisibility: This spell uses the ***GURPS Dungeon Fantasy*** variant rules. In general, any attack roll or spellcasting ends the spell, and the GM may rule that other overt actions also break invisibility. This supports *Elder Scrolls* stealth play without making invisibility a reliable “combat mode.”\n- Create Gate: This spell is renamed Create Oblivion Gate and is used to open a gate between Mundus and a realm of Oblivion, or between two realms of Oblivion. It is no longer treated as a general-purpose travel shortcut across Tamriel; whether it can be used repeatedly to travel between distant locations is left to the GM.\n\n### Removed Spells\nSome spells from ***GURPS Magic*** are not used in this setting. They are removed when they conflict with Tamrielic lore, undermine intended travel and exploration, or create balance outcomes that do not fit the desired tone of play.\n- Teleportation spells: Instant point-to-point teleportation is not part of standard mortal spellcraft in this setting. These effects are replaced by Mark and Recall and by Divine or Almsivi Intervention, which preserve setting-appropriate limitations on magical travel and allow the GM to control access to fast movement.\n- Time spells: Spells that manipulate time are removed because altering the flow of time is beyond the reach of nearly all mortal spellcasters in this setting and is better reserved for mythic beings, divine intervention, or major plot devices.\n- Missile Shield / Reverse Missiles: These spells are removed because their effects rely on assumptions about anti-magic materials and defensive paradigms that do not exist in this setting. Defensive magic is expected to take the form of wards, resistances, and blocking spells rather than blanket “no missiles may touch me” effects.\n- Hawk Flight: This spell is removed for balance and tone reasons. Reliable personal flight is intended to remain rare, costly, and significant rather than a routine utility spell.\n- Great Haste: This spell is removed because its impact on action economy is too strong for the intended combat feel and tends to overshadow other tactical choices.\n- Bless / Curse: These spells are removed because they do not match the setting’s approach to divine favor and misfortune and tend to blur the line between mortal spellcraft and the prerogatives of gods, saints, and major supernatural forces.\n- Technology spells: All Technology spells are removed because they do not align with the setting’s magical and technological assumptions and tend to push play toward a genre and tone that is not *The Elder Scrolls*.\n- Power: This spell is not used by this setting’s Enchanting system. Enchanting uses its own rules and resource structures, so Power is excluded to prevent conflicting approaches to creating and pricing enchanted items.\nAs always, the GM is free to add, remove, or modify spells to best suit the campaign’s needs.\n"
