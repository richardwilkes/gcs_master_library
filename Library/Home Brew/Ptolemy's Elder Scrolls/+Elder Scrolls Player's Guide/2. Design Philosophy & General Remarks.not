When multiple versions of a mechanic or feature existed, I generally leaned toward the *Morrowind* interpretation, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe goal of this project is to create a GURPS game that feels like the *Elder Scrolls*, not a perfect recreation of the video games. Characters earn and spend character points just like in standard GURPS, and the **Magic** spell list is used even when it contains spells never seen in the *Elder Scrolls* (like Body of Air or Iron Arm), because these spells feel thematically appropriate. Always keep in mind that The Elder Scrolls games were designed as video games, so many spells, powers, and mechanics are optimized for video gameplay rather than tabletop.\n\nThis system is designed as a modification of **Dungeon Fantasy**, which shares many of the same assumptions as *The Elder Scrolls*: adventurers based out of a town or guildhall, pursuing contracts and quests, delving into ruins, caves, and wild places, and returning to spend their earnings or advance their skills and get better equipment. In general, you should use **Dungeon Fantasy** assumptions, like Talents being limited to 6 levels instead of 4, and the rules, such as what rolls to make to find a job in a town.\n\nIf you find certain features jarring or incompatible with your preferred era or tone, such as Mark and Recall, Levitation, or other older-style spells, feel free to restrict or remove them. The same applies to the spell list overall: it is really just the **Magic** spell list with selected additions, removals, and adjustments to better reflect Tamriel’s world and lore.\n\nUltimately, the GM should always feel empowered to change, alter, or ignore any part of these rules to better fit their table. This content is meant to be a flexible framework, not a constraint, for bringing The Elder Scrolls to life in GURPS.\n\nIf the GM or player ever has any questions about *The Elder Scrolls* lore, I would encourage you to visit the **Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages** (https://en.uesp.net/wiki/).\n\n### The Bestiary\nThe **Elder Scrolls Bestiary** contains stat blocks for many of the unique enemies one can find in the Elder Scrolls games. These range in difficulty from the humble Scrib to the devastating Ash Vampire. Each enemy has a small note describing the creature and a note of the creature's tier of soul should it be captured with a Soul Trap spell. If the creature can carry diseases, this is noted, too. The GM is encouraged to modify these creatures as best fits the game.\n\n### Why Magicka Points?\nThe decision to use Magicka Points instead of Fatigue Points or an alternate resource like Quintessence is meant to better reflect the spirit of *The Elder Scrolls*. In the source material, Magicka is a distinct pool of energy separate from physical stamina. By keeping those resources apart, spellcasting becomes more practical and appealing. Characters no longer have to sacrifice their endurance or fighting ability to use magic.\n\nIn this system, a character’s Magicka Points function as an Energy Reserve equal to IQ. This gives dedicated mages a larger pool of energy to draw from than in standard **Magic**, allowing them to cast more freely and feel more like their counterparts in the games. At the same time, it gives non-mages a meaningful resource for powering enchanted items or casting minor spells through the Spell Focus perk. The result is a magic system that feels familiar to *Elder Scrolls* players while staying consistent with GURPS mechanics.\n\n### Why Ritual Magic?\nThe choice to use Ritual Magic as the foundation of the magic system was made to best reflect how spells function in *The Elder Scrolls* while keeping the system manageable for both players and GMs. In the source material, mages have access to a wide range of spells without strict prerequisites. Their ability to cast more powerful magic depends on their skill, not on having mastered simpler spells first. Ritual Magic naturally mirrors this structure: spells are techniques that grow easier to use as the caster’s mastery of a magical college improves.\n\nWhile some players prefer alternatives like Sorcery or Ritual Path Magic, these systems introduce significant complexity and shift away from the feel of *The Elder Scrolls*. Sorcery treats spells as powers that must be individually designed and purchased with character points, which limits a mage’s repertoire and makes experimentation costly, as well as requiring the time investment from players or GMs to make each spell as an individual power. Even with skill rolls required for each spell, Sorcery does not fully capture the sense of immense, learned mastery that defines powerful mages in the Elder Scrolls. Ritual Path Magic, while flexible and evocative, also demands extensive GM adjudication and introduces mechanics that don’t align well with the setting - such as improvised spells, charms, and long energy-gathering rituals. It would require heavy modification to fit *Elder Scrolls*-style spellcasting, where mages cast rapidly from fixed spell lists and rely on large Magicka reserves.\n\nRitual Magic, on the other hand, works cleanly with the feel of *Elder Scrolls* magic while keeping gameplay fast and intuitive. It allows GURPS spells to function almost exactly as they do in the games: a spell can vary in power, area, or duration, each affecting Magicka cost. Though it doesn’t allow for fully custom spells in the same way as *Daggerfall*, *Morrowind*, or *Oblivion*, it comes close - especially with the Link spell, which allows mages to combine effects creatively.\n\nThere are practical benefits as well. Using GURPS **Magic** as the base system simplifies Enchanting and Scroll creation, avoiding the need for complex item-construction systems like Meta-Tech. It also supports an in-world economy for learning spells - characters can spend gold rather than character points to expand their magical knowledge, encouraging exploration and adventure.\n\nIn short, Ritual Magic captures both the mechanics and the spirit of Elder Scrolls spellcasting. It rewards skill, preserves simplicity, and provides the depth needed for satisfying magical gameplay without burdening players or GMs with excessive complexity.\n"
