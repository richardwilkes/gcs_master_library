All diseases for this setting can be found in the **Elder Scrolls Diseases** library.\n\n### Contracting Diseases\nThe GM determines whether a creature is diseased. This can be decided narratively or by rolling against the creatureâ€™s HT. On a failure, the creature is infected. A creature can only carry one disease at a time.\n\nAll disease rolls are handled by the GM. Players should only know they have a disease once symptoms begin to appear. See each disease's description for its incubation period.\n\n- Non-Combat Exposure: If a character interacts with a diseased creature outside of combat, he must roll HT (modified by Fit, Very Fit, Unfit, and Resistant to Disease) once for every 5 minutes or fraction thereof of contact.\n- Combat Exposure: In combat, a character must roll HT each time he strikes a diseased creature at Range 1 or C, and each time the diseased creature strikes him with a melee attack.\n\n### Difficulty of Infection\n- Common Diseases: Roll at HT+2.\n- Blight Diseases: Roll at HT.\n- Corprus Disease: Roll at HT. NOTE: Corprus has no cure. Catching this disease is the equivalent of death.\n\n### Curing Diseases\nBecause of frequent HT rolls, the risk of infection is high, and some diseases are quite punishing. Fortunately, curing them is easy - if you have access to civilization. \n- When in a town, any temple or shrine can cure any and all diseases for a modest fee of $30.\n- In the Wilderness, you'll need a potion, spell, or scroll capable of curing disease."
