Adventurers are especially vulnerable due to frequent combat, exposure to the wilderness, and interaction with things best left untouched. While many illnesses are unpleasant but survivable, others carry lasting consequences or pose an existential threat if untreated.\nDiseases in this setting are meant to create pressure and urgency rather than bookkeeping. Symptoms may appear slowly, worsen over time, or strike suddenly, forcing characters to seek treatment or adapt to growing limitations.\nAll diseases used in this setting can be found in the **Elder Scrolls Diseases** library. Many creatures in the Bestiary list possible diseases they can spread.\n\n## Types of Diseases\nDiseases in Tamriel fall into three broad categories:\n- Common Diseases: Mundane illnesses spread by filth, vermin, spoiled food, and close contact. These are unpleasant but usually survivable with timely care.\n- Blight Diseases: Supernatural afflictions born of corruption, Daedric influence, or tainted land. These are more aggressive, harder to resist, and often carry lingering or escalating symptoms.\n- Corprus: A unique and horrific condition that warps both body and soul. Corprus defies natural law and resists all known cures. Characters who contract Corprus are effectively doomed unless an extraordinary narrative intervention occurs.\n\n## Contracting Diseases\nWhether a creature carries a disease is determined by the GM. This may be decided narratively or by rolling against the creature’s HT when it is introduced; on a failure, the creature is infected with an appropriate disease. A creature may only carry one disease at a time.\nAll disease-related rolls are made by the GM. Characters are not aware that they have contracted a disease until symptoms begin to manifest. Refer to each disease’s description for its incubation period.\n\n## Exposure and Infection\nNon-Combat Exposure:  \nIf a character interacts with a diseased creature outside of combat, he must roll HT once for every five minutes (or fraction thereof) of contact. Apply modifiers from Fit, Very Fit, Unfit, and Resistant to Disease as normal.\nCombat Exposure:  \nDuring combat, a character must roll HT each time he strikes a diseased creature at Range 1 or C, and each time a diseased creature strikes him with a melee attack.\n\n## Difficulty of Infection\nThe difficulty of resisting infection depends on the type of disease involved:\n- Common Diseases: Roll at HT +2  \n- Blight Diseases: Roll at HT  \n- Corprus: Roll at HT  \n\nCorprus has no cure. Contracting Corprus is effectively a death sentence unless the GM explicitly rules otherwise.\n\n## Curing Diseases\nBecause exposure checks are frequent and some diseases are quite punishing, infection is a serious threat. Fortunately, treatment is readily available to those with access to civilization.\n- When in a town or city, any temple or shrine can cure all diseases for a modest donation of $30.\n- In the Wilderness, characters must rely on potions, spells, or scrolls capable of curing disease.\n\nUnless otherwise noted in a disease’s description, all penalties persist until the disease is cured.\n"
