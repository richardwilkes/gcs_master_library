Tamrielâ€™s technology level is TL4, and while advanced armor and machinery exist, gunpowder weapons should be excluded unless the GM explicitly wishes to add something like Dwemer prototypes. Know that including firearms may well prevent the game from feeling like *The Elder Scrolls*.\n\nThe **Elder Scrolls Equipment** library includes a variety of setting-specific items:\n- Armor: Full sets from across Tamriel, including Dwarven, Glass, Ebony, and Daedric.\n- Narcotics: Includes Moon Sugar, Skooma, and Balmora Blue. These items can be traded or used, with effects and drawbacks listed in their individual descriptions.\n- Soul Gems: Used for Enchanting and Soul Trap magic (see the Enchanting section for more details).\n- Scrolls: A scroll template is provided for easy use by mages and alchemists alike.\n- Alchemy Equipment: Necessary for crafting potions; see the Alchemy section for details on alchemy kits and reagent use.\n- Reagents: Three tiers of reagent categories used for making potions. See the Alchemy section for more details.\n- Potions and Poisons: All common *Elder Scrolls* potions and poisons are available. Poisons follow the rules found in Dungeon Fantasy 1, p. 28.\n\n### Equipment Modifiers\n\nThe **Elder Scrolls Equipment Modifiers** library includes modifiers to apply special materials from the Elder Scrolls, such as Glass or Ebony, to Weapons and Shields.\n\nNote that the equipment modifiers in the library represent different materials and **cannot** be combined with each other. You can have a Fine Balanced Daedric Longsword, but you **cannot** have a Glass Ebony Longsword.\n\nAll the equipment modifiers in **Low-Tech** are available for gear.\n\nMany equipment modifiers from **Dungeon Fantasy** are available, but several are not. The following equipment modifiers are **not available**:\n- Elven\n- Dwarven\n- Meteoric\n- Orichalcum\n"
