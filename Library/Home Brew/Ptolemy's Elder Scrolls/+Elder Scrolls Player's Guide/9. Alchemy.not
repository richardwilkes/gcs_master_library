A large list of potions and their effects can be found in the **Elder Scrolls Equipment** library. GMs should feel free to use these as well as potions from other GURPS content, like **Dungeon Fantasy** or **Magic**.\n\n### Cost and Reagents\nThe cost to make a potion is 60% of its retail value. The reagents required to make a potion are based on the potion's creation cost, not the potion’s sale price. \n\nReagents come in three tiers: Common, Rare, and Exotic. These are tracked as abstract pools of ingredients by tier, not as individual ingredients. Whenever you use reagents, always round to the nearest $ amount.\n\nTo brew a potion, you must spend 75% of its cost in reagents of its own tier or higher. The remaining 25% may be made up of lower-tier reagents. Higher-tier reagents can substitute for lower-tier ones, but not vice versa.\n\nExample: A Rare potion that costs $600 to make would require $450 worth of Rare or better reagents, and $150 worth from any source.\n\n### Potion Tiers\nPotion effects, like Restore HP, Resist Fire, or Flight, are divided into three broad tiers and are tied to reagents: Common, Rare, and Exotic.\n\nSpecific potions are then divided into three broad tiers of potency: Standard, Quality, and Exquisite.\n\nThe potions in the **Elder Scrolls Equipment** library are tagged either Common, Rare, or Exotic by the potion's effect.\n\n### Brewing Potions\nWhen brewing a potion, the GM rolls against the character’s Alchemy skill. The potion’s effect and potency both impose penalties to the roll, as follows:\n\nEffects Tier:\n- Common: no penalty\n- Rare: -2\n- Exotic: -4\n\nPotency Tier:\n- Standard: no penalty\n- Quality: -2\n- Exquisite: -4\n\nThese penalties stack - brewing a potion that has a Rare effect and a Quality potency gives a total of -4 to the Alchemy roll to brew the potion.\n\nFailure wastes the reagents. On a critical failure, the brewer believes the potion succeeded, but it has an unintended negative or reversed effect instead.\n\nA player may never use any form of Luck, including Super Luck, on the Alchemy roll to brew a potion.\n\n### Brewing Time\nPotions need to brew for minutes equal to their retail value. A potion that is valued at $300 needs to brew for 300 minutes, or 5 hours. The alchemist must attend to that brew for at least half of the brewing time.\n\n### Multiple Effects\nA potion can have up to four effects.\nAdd the baseline cost of all effects together. Then increase the total cost by 50% per additional effect.\nApply a −3 penalty to the Alchemy roll for each additional effect beyond the first.\nEach effect must still meet its reagent tier requirement.\n\nExample: Suppose a potion combining a Rare effect and a Common effect has a combined brewing cost of $800. Because it has one extra effect, multiply this by 1.5 for a total cost of $1,200. Since one of its effects is Rare, it must include at least $900 worth of Rare or higher reagents.\n\n### Potion Tolerance\nDrinking multiple potions in a short period is overwhelming on the gut. Whenever a character drinks more than one potion within ten minutes, he must roll against HT−2 or become Nauseated (B428) for minutes equal to Margin of Failure x 5.\n\nThis roll is modified by traits like Fit, Very Fit, Unfit, and High Pain Threshold.\n\nCharacters with Alchemy 12 reduce this penalty to 0.\nCharacters with Alchemy 14 get a +2 to their HT roll.\n\nThe Potion Tolerance perk provides a +2 bonus to this roll. This perk stacks with the Alchemy skill benefits above, allowing master alchemists to consume multiple potions with much less risk.\n\n## Gathering Reagents\nReagents can be gathered from the environment using the Alchemy or Naturalist skills. If a character is guided by someone with Alchemy or Naturalist at skill 14 or higher, the character may instead roll Survival −3 to gather. A character using Survival must have at least one point in the appropriate Survival specialization and may not default from a different specialization.\n\nEach environment has a baseline reagent value per gathering attempt, shown below. The tier mix of the haul depends on the region. One gathering attempt takes two hours. Players may take extra time to get a bonus to their gathering roll. A character may make no more than one gathering roll per week in the same area.\n\nCompute gathered reagents like this. Start with the environment baseline, then apply the margin modifier:\n\n- Final haul = baseline × (100% + 20% per Margin of Success (MoS), or −40% per Margin of Failure (MoF)).\n- Minimum haul is 0% (a deep failure yields nothing).\n\nOn a critical success, up to 25% of the final haul is upgraded one tier. Upgrade Common to Rare first, then Rare to Exotic, until 25% of the haul has been upgraded or no eligible reagent remains to upgrade. Record the new tiered breakdown and round to whole dollars/units.\n\nOn a critical failure, the GM should impose some negative consequences, such as disease or a dangerous encounter.\n\nRound reagent totals to whole dollars/units at the end of the calculation.\n\nExample: baseline = $200 in a swamp; MoS = 2 → haul = 200 × (100% + 40%) = $280. Tier split before upgrade: 60% Common ($168), 30% Rare ($84), 10% Exotic ($28). On a critical success, 25% of $280 = $70 is upgraded. Upgrade Common to Rare until $70 is moved: $70 of Common becomes Rare, leaving Common $98, Rare $154, Exotic $28.\n\nBelow are the baseline gathering amounts for different regions. Each region is given a $ amount that is broken up into portions of Common, Rare, or Exotic ingredients.\n\n- Arctic: $200;   70% Common / 25% Rare / 5% Exotic\n- Desert: $180;   60% Common / 30% Rare / 10% Exotic\n- Island/Beach: $250;   75% Common / 20% Rare/ 5% Exotic\n- Jungle: $320;   50% Common / 35% Rare / 15% Exotic\n- Mountain: $240;   65% Common / 30% Rare / 5% Exotic\n- Plains: $270;   80% Common / 20% Rare / 0% Exotic\n- River/Lake: $280;   70% Common / 25% Rare / 5% Exotic\n- Swampland: $300;   60% Common / 30% Rare / 10% Exotic\n- Woodlands: $270;   75% Common / 20% Rare / 5% Exotic\n- Ashlands: $250;   40% Common / 40% Rare / 20% Exotic\n- Subterranean: $220;   50% Common / 35% Rare / 15% Exotic\n- Daedric Ruin: $300;   30% Common / 40% Rare / 30% Exotic\n- Oblivion: $350;   20% Common / 40% Rare / 40% Exotic\n- Urban: $180;   90% Common / 10% Rare / 0% Exotic"
