Minor charms and trinkets are easily found, while powerful enchanted arms and artifacts are exceedingly rare and command staggering prices.\n\nEnchanting is the art of binding magical effects into objects by channeling the power of captured souls. Unlike other forms of magic, an enchanter does not invest their own energy into the process - the soul contained within a Soul Gem provides all the energy required for the enchantment.\n\nIn general, enchanting follows the rules described in GURPS **Magic**, but with several major changes.\n\n### Using Enchanted Items\nAnyone, mage or non-mage, may use enchanted items. Whenever a spell's description in **Magic** states that an enchanted item can only be used by mages, ignore it.\n\n### Souls and Soul Gems\nSouls are the vital essence of living beings, and the key to all enchanting. Using the Soul Trap spell or an enchanted weapon bearing that effect, an enchanter can capture the soul of a recently slain creature and store it within a Soul Gem.\n\nSouls are divided into five tiers based on the creatureâ€™s point value: Petty (Less than 0), Lesser (1 - 100 points), Common (101 - 200 points), Greater (201 - 300 points), and Grand (301+ points). Soul Gems come in matching tiers. A Soul Gem of a higher tier can hold souls of a lower one, but each gem may contain only a single soul, and once that soul is used for an enchantment, the gem is destroyed.\n\nYou cannot capture the soul of a summoned creature in a Soul Gem.\n\nEach tier of soul provides a specific amount of energy and power, as per the Power spell (**Magic**, p. 57):\n- Petty souls: 250 energy, 1 Power\n- Lesser souls: 500 energy, 2 Power\n- Common souls: 2,000 energy, 3 Power\n- Greater souls: 4,000 energy, 4 Power\n- Grand souls: 8,000 energy, 5 Power\n\nThis also means that players cannot make any enchantment that requires more than 8,000 energy.\n\n### The Enchanting Process\nIn addition to the soul gem, enchanting costs a monetary amount per point of energy.\n\nIf you enchant your own item, it costs $5 per point of energy.\n\nIf you pay the Mages Guild or another professional to do it for you, the price depends on the size of the enchantment:\n- Up to 250 energy: $10 per point\n- Up to 500 energy: $15 per point\n- Up to 2,000 energy: $20 per point\n- Up to 4,000 energy: $25 per point\n- Up to 8,000 energy: $30 per point\n\nNPC enchanters typically never fail - or, if they do, they refund the cost of the enchantment and a portion of the destroyed item.\n\n### Skill and Difficulty\n\nTo enchant an item, the caster must know both the Enchant spell and the specific spell being placed into the item (such as Resist Fire or Cornucopia) at skill level of 10 or higher.\n\nThere is a penalty of -1 to effective skill for every 1,000 energy in the enchantment.\nFor example, an enchantment that requires 500 energy has no penalty, while an enchantment requiring 6,250 energy applies a -6 penalty.\n\nThe final roll is made at the lower of the two relevant spells, and only once, at the end of the process. The GM rolls secretly.\n\nIf the roll fails, the soul gem, its contained soul, and the enchanted item are all destroyed. No form of Luck (including Super Luck) can be used on an enchantment roll.\n\n\n## Scrolls\nScrolls are single-use magical items inscribed with a pre-cast spell, ready to release its power when read aloud. Unlike enchanted items, they are simple to use and require no innate magical ability.\n\nAnyone can use a scroll, mages and non-mages alike. When activated, the scroll releases the stored spell exactly as written, using the skill level of its creator. \n\nUsers pay no MP of their own to use a scroll, and they cannot modify the effect, add energy, or change the scroll's parameters. Scrolls are created with all of the energy required for the spell already infused within them. The magic is entirely self-contained.\n\n### Creation\n\nCreating a scroll follows the general process of Scroll (**Magic**, p. 57), with the following changes:\n\n- Anyone who knows the spell can craft a scroll of it.\n- The time required is 1 hour per point of energy, rather than 1 day per point.\n- The scroll's creator spends the MP that the scroll will use.\n- The cost to make a scroll is $30 per point of energy.\n- The cost to buy a scroll is $50 per point of energy.\n- The scroll's creator must know both the spell Scroll and the spell being written in the scroll at skill level 10 or higher. \n- The creator rolls once against the lower of the spells involved. No form of Luck, including Super Luck, may be used. The GM makes this roll in secret. On a failure, the scroll fails and the money spent on materials is lost. On a critical failure, the scroll will backfire when used!\n\nOnce inscribed, the scroll holds the spell indefinitely until used. When the spell is cast, the scroll disintegrates.\n\nExamples\n- A 3d Fireball scroll: contains 3 energy, cost to make: $90, cost to buy: $150.\n- A Haste scroll, granting +3 Move/Dodge for 3 minutes: contains 12 energy, cost to make: $360, cost to buy: $600.\n- A Scroll of Divine Intervention that can teleport the caster and three other subjects: contains 18 energy, cost to make: $540, cost to buy: $900."
