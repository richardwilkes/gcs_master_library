This includes new traits, perks, and variations of existing GURPS advantages designed to better capture the feel of Tamriel.\n\n### Languages\nEvery race by default speaks Tamrielic. GMs who prefer greater linguistic diversity may assign additional racial languages as desired. All languages beyond Tamrielic require GM approval.\n\n### Magic Traits\n- Magery: A modified form of Ritual Magery (Basic Set p.242, Thaumatology p.72) that uses the 7 colleges of *The Elder Scrolls* magic. Details can be found in the Magic section. Use the Magery trait found in this library, or those built into Race, Birthsign, or Class templates.\n- Spell Focus (Perk): Allows non-mages to improve a specific spell. Not available to characters with Magery 1 or greater. Detailed in the Magic section.\n- Specialty Magic Mastery: A series of Talents corresponding to GURPS Magic colleges (e.g., Fire, Movement, Gate) that provide bonuses to related spells. Only available to characters with Magery 1 or greater.\n\n### Talents\nMost Talents are racial and restricted to the race they describe. Apprentice’s Gifts is limited to those born under the sign of The Apprentice. The only unrestricted Talent is Legion Training, available to any character who served in the Imperial Legions.\n\n### Other Traits\n- Insubstantiality: In Tamriel, most magical and many non-magical weapons can harm insubstantial foes. For this setting, the Insubstantial trait must take the Achilles Heel (-50%) limitation.\n- Weirdness Magnet (Bethesda Jank): A humorous, optional trait requiring GM approval. It entitles the GM to inflict “Bethesda-style” bugs on the player, such as getting stuck on invisible walls or being unable to turn in a quest.\n\n### Perks\n- Faction Affiliation: Represents the lowest level of association with a guild, house, or other faction. The character has a Claim to Hospitality with the faction, gaining basic lodging, sustenance, and entry-level work, but no Patron benefits or Duties. Rivals of the faction may react negatively.\n- Compounding Alchemist: Reduces the penalty for creating potions with multiple effects from -2 per additional effect to -1. See the Alchemy section for details.\n- Potion Tolerance: Gives a bonus to +2 HT rolls made when drinking more than one potion within 10 minutes.\n"
