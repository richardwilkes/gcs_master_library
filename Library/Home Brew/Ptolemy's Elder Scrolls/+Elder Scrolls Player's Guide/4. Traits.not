This includes new traits, perks, Talents, and setting-specific variations of existing ***GURPS*** advantages designed to better capture the feel of Tamriel while integrating cleanly with ***GURPS*** mechanics.\n\n## Languages\nBy default, all characters speak Tamrielic. This reflects the widespread use of a common tongue across Tamriel for trade, governance, and daily life. GMs who prefer greater linguistic diversity may assign additional racial or regional languages as appropriate. Any language beyond Tamrielic requires GM approval, typically reflecting regional upbringing, race, or background.\n\n## Modified Traits\nSeveral existing ***GURPS*** traits function differently in this setting.\n\n### Magery\nIn this conversion, Magery is a modified form of Ritual Magery adapted to use the seven *Elder Scrolls* magic colleges. Characters should use the Magery trait provided in this library, or the versions included in Race, Birthsign, or Class templates.\n\n### Insubstantiality\nIn Tamriel, most magical weapons and many non-magical weapons are capable of harming insubstantial beings. As a result, Insubstantiality in this setting must include the Achilles Heel (Affected by many weapons and all magic) limitation at -50%.\n\n### Weirdness Magnet (Bethesda Jank)\nThis is an optional, humorous variation of the standard Weirdness Magnet disadvantage and requires GM approval. Characters with this trait invite unpredictable, glitch-like mishaps reminiscent of *Elder Scrolls* video game quirks, such as becoming stuck on invisible obstacles or encountering quest-breaking complications.\n\n## New Traits and Talents\nThis conversion introduces a number of new traits and Talents representing cultural training, inherited aptitude, or institutional discipline. Most Talents are racial and may only be purchased by members of the appropriate race.\nA few exceptions exist. Apprentice’s Gifts is restricted to characters born under the sign of *The Apprentice*, while Legion Training is the only Talent not restricted by race or Birthsign and is available to characters who served in the Imperial Legions.\n\n### Specialty Magic Mastery\nSpecialty Magic Mastery represents a family of Talents tied to specific ***GURPS Magic*** colleges, such as Fire, Movement, or Gate. These Talents provide bonuses to spells associated with their respective colleges and are available only to characters with Magery 1 or greater. Characters must specialize by Magic college.\n\n### Hard to Read \nThis is the opposite of Easy to Read and imposes a -2 penalty on Empathy, Body Language, Psychology, and Detect Lies rolls made to discern the character’s truthfulness or intent. This trait is a racial trait for Argonians but may be purchased by others with GM approval.\n\n## Perks\nSeveral perks are unique to this setting and are available through the **Elder Scrolls Traits** library.\n\n### Faction Affiliation\nFaction Affiliation represents the lowest level of official association with a guild, Great House, or similar organization. The character gains a Claim to Hospitality, including basic lodging, sustenance, and access to entry-level work, but does not receive Patron benefits or incur formal Duties. Members of rival factions may react negatively.\n\n### Fast Weapon Binding\nThis perk allows a character to instantly summon and ready a single specific bound weapon as though it were successfully Fast-Drawn. It must be specialized to a specific bound weapon, such as Bound Broadsword or Bound Saber. Any bound weapon can have a version of this perk.\n\n### Compounding Alchemist\nThis perk reduces the penalty for brewing potions with multiple effects from -2 per additional effect to -1.\n\n### Potion Tolerance\nThis perk grants a +2 bonus to HT rolls made when consuming more than one potion within a ten-minute period.\n\n### Spell Focus\nSpell Focus is a leveled perk that allows characters with Magery 0 or no Magery to improve a single specific spell beyond their base skill. This perk is not available to characters with Magery 1 or greater, as full spellcasting aptitude supersedes this focused specialization.\n"
