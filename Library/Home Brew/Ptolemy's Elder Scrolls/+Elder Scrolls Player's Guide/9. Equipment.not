The setting operates at TL4, and nearly all equipment from ***GURPS Low-Tech*** and ***GURPS Dungeon Fantasy*** is appropriate for use, with the notable exception of firearms. \nFirearms are not part of the default setting. While the GM may choose to introduce rare Dwemer prototypes or cannons inspired by *The Elder Scrolls: Redguard*, doing so will significantly alter the tone of play and move the game away from the traditional feel of *The Elder Scrolls*.\nAll setting-specific equipment can be found in the **Elder Scrolls Equipment** library.\n\n## Elder Scrolls Equipment\nThe **Elder Scrolls Equipment** library contains a wide range of items unique to the setting, including cultural arms and armor, legendary materials, and alchemical goods.\nThis includes, but is not limited to:\n- **Armor:** Full armor sets from across Tamriel, including cultural styles and rare materials such as Chitin, Bonemold, Dwemer, Glass, Ebony, Daedric, and Dragonbone. Availability may vary by region, culture, or era, at the GM’s discretion.\n- **Soul Gems:** Crystalline vessels used to capture and store souls for Enchanting and the Soul Trap spell. Soul gems have a base value for the empty crystal, and captured souls add additional value based on their tier.\n- **Scrolls:** Scroll templates suitable for use by spellcasters and non-mages alike.\n- **Alchemy Equipment:** Alchemical tools ranging from portable field kits to full laboratories, which provide bonuses to Alchemy rolls based on quality.\n- **Reagents:** Alchemical reagents divided into three tiers—Common, Rare, and Exotic—used to create potions and other alchemical substances.\n- **Potions and Poisons:** Standardized potions and poisons reflecting common effects found throughout *The Elder Scrolls*.\n- **Narcotics:** Substances such as Moon Sugar, Skooma, and Balmora Blue, which function as powerful stimulants with escalating benefits, risks, and long-term consequences.\nDetailed statistics, costs, weights, and mechanical effects for all of these items are provided in the library entries themselves.\n\n## Equipment Modifiers\nSpecial materials from *The Elder Scrolls*, such as Glass, Ebony, Daedric, and Dragonbone, are represented using equipment modifiers applied to weapons and shields. These modifiers reflect the underlying material and craftsmanship of the item rather than superficial decoration.\n\nMaterial-based equipment modifiers **cannot be combined with one another**. For example, a Fine Balanced Ebony Longsword is possible, but a Glass Ebony Longsword is not. Each item has a single defining material.\nNon-material modifiers may be combined with material modifiers when appropriate.\nAll equipment modifiers from ***GURPS Low-Tech*** are available unless otherwise stated. Many modifiers from ***GURPS Dungeon Fantasy*** are also usable; however, some are excluded because their effects are already represented by Elder Scrolls materials or they do not fit the setting.\nThe following ***GURPS Dungeon Fantasy*** equipment modifiers are **not available**:\n- Elven  \n- Dwarven  \n- Meteoric  \n- Orichalcum  \nAll Elder Scrolls–specific weapon and shield modifiers, including those for special materials and cultural craftsmanship, are provided in the **Elder Scrolls Equipment Modifiers** library.\n\n## Availability and GM Discretion\nAvailability of equipment should always be shaped by region, culture, and era. Exotic or high-tier equipment should be rare, costly, and often tied to specific locations, factions, or quests. The GM is encouraged to restrict, reskin, or adjust availability to suit the campaign’s tone and themes.\n"
