# GCS Master Library Data

GURPS[^1] Character Sheet (GCS) is a stand-alone, interactive, character sheet editor that allows you to build
characters for the [GURPS](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps) 4<sup>th</sup> Edition roleplaying game system.

This repository holds the Master Library data files for the [GCS project](https://github.com/richardwilkes/gcs).

Most of the data here has been entered in by users of GCS and contributed back to the project for everyone to make use
of. If you see mistakes or omissions that you've fixed in your copy, or have data files you'd like to contribute, please
create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
to get them merged into the Master Library. A [contributor](https://github.com/rinickolous) to the library created
[this short video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-sRU0vbxLw) demonstrating the Pull Request process. If you
are unable to create a Pull Request for some reason, you can instead
[create an Issue](https://github.com/richardwilkes/gcs_master_library/issues/new) and attach the file(s) containing your
changes to it, along with an explanation of what it is you changed.

When adding page references, please use the [abbreviations from this list](https://gurpscharactersheet.com/page_references.html).
If the book isn't in the list yet, please ask what should be used so that this list can be updated appropriately.
